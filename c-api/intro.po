"The Application Programmer's Interface to Python gives C and C++ programmers"
" access to the Python interpreter at a variety of levels.  The API is "
"equally usable from C++, but for brevity it is generally referred to as the "
"Python/C API.  There are two fundamentally different reasons for using the "
"Python/C API. The first reason is to write *extension modules* for specific "
"purposes; these are C modules that extend the Python interpreter.  This is "
"probably the most common use.  The second reason is to use Python as a "
"component in a larger application; this technique is generally referred to "
"as :dfn:`embedding` Python in an application."

"Python 的应用编程接口（API）使得 C 和 C++ 程序员可以在多个层级上访问 Python 解释器。该 API 在 C++ "

"*扩展模块*；它们是扩展 Python 解释器功能的 C 模块。这可能是最常见的使用场景。第二个理由是将 Python "

"The reference count is important because today's computers have a  finite "

"places there are that have a reference to an object.  Such a  place could be"
" another object, or a global (or static) C variable, or  a local variable in"
" some C function. When an object's reference count  becomes zero, the object"

"turn, if this decrement makes their reference count become zero, and so on."

"for now, the solution is  \"don't do that.\")"

"Reference counts are always manipulated explicitly.  The normal way is  to "
"use the macro :c:func:`Py_INCREF` to increment an object's reference count "
"by one, and :c:func:`Py_DECREF` to decrement it by   one.  The "
":c:func:`Py_DECREF` macro is considerably more complex than the incref one, "
"since it must check whether the reference count becomes zero and then cause "
"the object's deallocator to be called. The deallocator is a function pointer"
" contained in the object's type structure.  The type-specific deallocator "
"takes care of decrementing the reference counts for other objects contained "
"in the object if this is a compound object type, such as a list, as well as "
"performing any additional finalization that's needed.  There's no chance "
"that the reference count can overflow; at least as many bits are used to "
"hold the reference count as there are distinct memory locations in virtual "
"memory (assuming ``sizeof(Py_ssize_t) >= sizeof(void*)``). Thus, the "
"reference count increment is a simple operation."
msgstr ""

#: ../../c-api/intro.rst:271
msgid ""
"It is not necessary to increment an object's reference count for every  "
"local variable that contains a pointer to an object.  In theory, the  "
"object's reference count goes up by one when the variable is made to  point "
"to it and it goes down by one when the variable goes out of  scope.  "
"However, these two cancel each other out, so at the end the  reference count"
" hasn't changed.  The only real reason to use the  reference count is to "
"prevent the object from being deallocated as  long as our variable is "
"pointing to it.  If we know that there is at  least one other reference to "
"the object that lives at least as long as our variable, there is no need to "
"increment the reference count  temporarily. An important situation where "
"this arises is in objects  that are passed as arguments to C functions in an"
" extension module  that are called from Python; the call mechanism "
"guarantees to hold a  reference to every argument for the duration of the "
"call."

"However, a common pitfall is to extract an object from a list and hold on to"

"innocent-looking operations may invoke arbitrary Python code which could do "

"The reference count behavior of functions in the Python/C API is best  "

"references, never to objects (objects are not owned: they are always "
"shared).  \"Owning a reference\" means being responsible for calling "
"Py_DECREF on it when the reference is no longer needed.  Ownership can also "
"be transferred, meaning that the code that receives ownership of the "
"reference then becomes responsible for eventually decref'ing it by calling "
":c:func:`Py_DECREF` or :c:func:`Py_XDECREF` when it's no longer needed---or "
"passing on this responsibility (usually to its caller). When a function "

":c:func:`PyList_SetItem` and :c:func:`PyTuple_SetItem`, which  steal a "

"common idiom for populating a tuple or list with newly created objects; for "
