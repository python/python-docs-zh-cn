"Perhaps one of the most important structures of the Python object system is "
"the structure that defines a new type: the :c:type:`PyTypeObject` structure."
"  Type objects can be handled using any of the :c:func:`PyObject_\\*` or "
":c:func:`PyType_\\*` functions, but do not offer much that's interesting to "
"most Python applications. These objects are fundamental to how objects "
"behave, so they are very important to the interpreter itself and to any "
"extension module that implements new types."

"应用程序所感兴趣的内容。 这些对象是对象行为的基础，所以它们对解释器本身或任何实现新类型的扩展模块都非常重要。"

"Type objects are fairly large compared to most of the standard types. The "
"reason for the size is that each type object stores a large number of "

"detail in this section.  The fields will be described in the order in which "
"they occur in the structure."

"与大多数标准类型相比，类型对象相当大。这么大的原因是每个类型对象存储了大量的值，大部分是C函数指针，每个指针实现了类型功能的一小部分。本节将详细描述类型对象的字段。这些字段将按照它们在结构中出现的顺序进行描述。"
