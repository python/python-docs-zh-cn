":c:func:`PyObject_Hash`, :c:func:`PyObject_Repr`, :c:func:`PyObject_IsTrue`,"

"This subtype of :c:type:`PyObject` is used to hold the internal data for "
"both :class:`set` and :class:`frozenset` objects.  It is like a "
":c:type:`PyDictObject` in that it is a fixed size for small sets (much like "
"tuple storage) and will point to a separate, variable sized block of memory "
"for medium and large sized sets (much like list storage). None of the fields"
" of this structure should be considered public and are subject to change.  "
"All access should be done through the documented API rather than by "
"manipulating the values in the structure."
