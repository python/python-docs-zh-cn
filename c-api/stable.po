"Python's C API is covered by the Backwards Compatibility Policy, :pep:`387`."
" While the C API will change with every minor release (e.g. from 3.9 to "
"3.10), most changes will be source-compatible, typically by only adding new "
"API. Changing existing API or removing API is only done after a deprecation "
"period or to fix serious issues."

"Python 的 C 语言 API 包含于向下兼容政策 :pep:`387` 中。C API 会跟随小版本的发布而发生变化（比如 3.9 到 3.10 "
"的时候），不过大多数变化都是源代码级兼容的，通常只会增加新的 API。已有 API 的修改或删除，只有在废止期过后或修复严重问题时才会进行。"

"CPython's Application Binary Interface (ABI) is forward- and backwards-"
"compatible across a minor release (if these are compiled the same way; see "
":ref:`stable-abi-platform` below). So, code compiled for Python 3.10.0 will "
"work on 3.10.8 and vice versa, but will need to be compiled separately for "
"3.9.x and 3.10.x."
msgstr ""
"CPython 的应用二进制接口（ABI）可以跨小版本实现前后兼容（只要以同样方式编译；参见下面的 :ref:`stable-abi-platform`"
" ）。因此，用 Python 3.10.0 编译的代码可以在 3.10.8 上运行，反之亦然，但针对 3.9.x 和 3.10.x 则需分别进行编译。"

"Python 3.2 introduced the *Limited API*, a subset of Python's C API. "
"Extensions that only use the Limited API can be compiled once and work with "
"multiple versions of Python. Contents of the Limited API are :ref:`listed "

"To enable this, Python provides a *Stable ABI*: a set of symbols that will "
"remain compatible across Python 3.x versions. The Stable ABI contains "
"symbols exposed in the Limited API, but also other ones – for example, "
"functions necessary to support older versions of the Limited API."

"Define ``Py_LIMITED_API`` to the value of :c:data:`PY_VERSION_HEX` "

"version."

"Rather than using the ``PY_VERSION_HEX`` macro directly, hardcode a minimum "

"On some platforms, Python will look for and load shared library files named "
"with the ``abi3`` tag (e.g. ``mymodule.abi3.so``). It does not check if such"

"For example, while :c:func:`PyList_GetItem` is available, its “unsafe” macro"

"Without ``Py_LIMITED_API`` defined, some C API functions are inlined or "

"By leaving out the ``Py_LIMITED_API`` definition, it is possible to compile "
"a Limited API extension with a version-specific ABI. This can improve "
"performance for that Python version, but will limit compatibility. Compiling"

"distributed where a version-specific one is not available – for example, for"
" prereleases of an upcoming Python version."

"Note that compiling with ``Py_LIMITED_API`` is *not* a complete guarantee "
"that code conforms to the Limited API or the Stable ABI. ``Py_LIMITED_API`` "
"only covers definitions, but an API also includes other issues, such as "
"expected semantics."
msgstr ""

#: ../../c-api/stable.rst:108
msgid ""
"One issue that ``Py_LIMITED_API`` does not guard against is calling a "
"function with arguments that are invalid in a lower Python version. For "
"example, consider a function that starts accepting ``NULL`` for an argument."
" In Python 3.9, ``NULL`` now selects a default behavior, but in Python 3.8, "
"the argument will be used directly, causing a ``NULL`` dereference and "
"crash. A similar argument works for fields of structs."
msgstr ""

#: ../../c-api/stable.rst:115
msgid ""
"Another issue is that some struct fields are currently not hidden when "
"``Py_LIMITED_API`` is defined, even though they're part of the Limited API."
msgstr ""

#: ../../c-api/stable.rst:118
msgid ""
"For these reasons, we recommend testing an extension with *all* minor Python"
" versions it supports, and preferably to build with the *lowest* such "
"version."
msgstr ""

#: ../../c-api/stable.rst:121
msgid ""
"We also recommend reviewing documentation of all used API to check if it is "
"explicitly part of the Limited API. Even with ``Py_LIMITED_API`` defined, a "
"few private declarations are exposed for technical reasons (or even "
"unintentionally, as bugs)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../c-api/stable.rst:126
msgid ""
"Also note that the Limited API is not necessarily stable: compiling with "
"``Py_LIMITED_API`` with Python 3.8 means that the extension will run with "
"Python 3.12, but it will not necessarily *compile* with Python 3.12. In "
"particular, parts of the Limited API may be deprecated and removed, provided"
" that the Stable ABI stays stable."

"ABI stability depends not only on Python, but also on the compiler used, "

msgid ""
"It is the responsibility of each particular distributor of Python to ensure "
