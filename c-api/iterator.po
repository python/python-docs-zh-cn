"Python provides two general-purpose iterator objects.  The first, a sequence"
" iterator, works with an arbitrary sequence supporting the "
":meth:`__getitem__` method.  The second works with a callable object and a "
"sentinel value, calling the callable for each item in the sequence, and "
"ending the iteration when the sentinel value is returned."

"Return a new iterator.  The first parameter, *callable*, can be any Python "
"callable object that can be called with no parameters; each call to it "
"should return the next item in the iteration.  When *callable* returns a "
"value equal to *sentinel*, the iteration will be terminated."
