"The functions in this chapter interact with Python objects regardless of "
"their type, or with wide classes of object types (e.g. all numerical types, "
"or all sequence types).  When used on object types for which they do not "
"apply, they will raise a Python exception."

"本章中的函数与 Python对象交互，无论其类型，或具有广泛类的对象类型（例如，所有数值类型，或所有序列类型）。当使用对象类型并不适用时，他们会产生一个"
