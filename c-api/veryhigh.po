"Several of these functions accept a start symbol from the grammar as a "

"Note also that several of these functions take :c:type:`FILE*` parameters.  "
"One particular issue which needs to be handled carefully is that the "
":c:type:`FILE` structure for different C libraries can be different and "
"incompatible.  Under Windows (at least), it is possible for dynamically "
"linked extensions to actually use different libraries, so care should be "
"taken that :c:type:`FILE*` parameters are only passed to these functions if "
"it is certain that they were created by the same library that the Python "
"runtime is using."

"important to note that the argument list may be modified (but the contents "
"of the strings pointed to by the argument list are not). The return value "
