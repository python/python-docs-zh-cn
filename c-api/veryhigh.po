"Several of these functions accept a start symbol from the grammar as a "
"parameter.  The available start symbols are :const:`Py_eval_input`, "
":const:`Py_file_input`, and :const:`Py_single_input`.  These are described "
"following the functions which accept them as parameters."

"Note also that several of these functions take :c:type:`FILE\\*` parameters."
"  One particular issue which needs to be handled carefully is that the "
":c:type:`FILE` structure for different C libraries can be different and "
"incompatible.  Under Windows (at least), it is possible for dynamically "
"linked extensions to actually use different libraries, so care should be "
"taken that :c:type:`FILE\\*` parameters are only passed to these functions "
"if it is certain that they were created by the same library that the Python "
"runtime is using."

"of the strings pointed to by the argument list are not). The return value "
