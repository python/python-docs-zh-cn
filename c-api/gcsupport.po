"Python's support for detecting and collecting garbage which involves "
"circular references requires support from object types which are "
"\"containers\" for other objects which may also be containers.  Types which "
"do not store references to other objects, or which only store references to "
"atomic types (such as numbers or strings), do not need to provide any "
"explicit support for garbage collection."
