"The functions described in this chapter will let you handle and raise Python"
" exceptions.  It is important to understand some of the basics of Python "
"exception handling.  It works somewhat like the POSIX :c:data:`errno` "
"variable: there is a global indicator (per thread) of the last error that "
"occurred.  Most C API functions don't clear this on success, but will set it"
" to indicate the cause of the error on failure.  Most C API functions also "
"return an error indicator, usually ``NULL`` if they are supposed to return a"
" pointer, or ``-1`` if they return an integer (exception: the "
":c:func:`PyArg_\\*` functions return ``1`` for success and ``0`` for "
"failure)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../c-api/exceptions.rst:20
msgid ""
"Concretely, the error indicator consists of three object pointers: the "
"exception's type, the exception's value, and the traceback object.  Any of "
"those pointers can be ``NULL`` if non-set (although some combinations are "
"forbidden, for example you can't have a non-``NULL`` traceback if the "
"exception type is ``NULL``)."

"When a function must fail because some function it called failed, it "
"generally doesn't set the error indicator; the function it called already "
"set it.  It is responsible for either handling the error and clearing the "
"exception or returning after cleaning up any resources it holds (such as "
"object references or memory allocations); it should *not* continue normally "
"if it is not prepared to handle the error.  If returning due to an error, it"
" is important to indicate to the caller that an error has been set.  If the "
"error is not handled or carefully propagated, additional calls into the "
"Python/C API may not behave as intended and may fail in mysterious ways."
