msgid ""
"These functions were part of the \"old buffer protocol\" API in Python 2. In"
" Python 3, this protocol doesn't exist anymore but the functions are still "
"exposed to ease porting 2.x code.  They act as a compatibility wrapper "
"around the :ref:`new buffer protocol <bufferobjects>`, but they don't give "
"you control over the lifetime of the resources acquired when a buffer is "
"exported."

"Therefore, it is recommended that you call :c:func:`PyObject_GetBuffer` (or "
"the ``y*`` or ``w*`` :ref:`format codes <arg-parsing>` with the "
":c:func:`PyArg_ParseTuple` family of functions) to get a buffer view over an"
" object, and :c:func:`PyBuffer_Release` when the buffer view can be "
"released."

"Returns a pointer to a read-only memory location usable as character-based "
"input.  The *obj* argument must support the single-segment character buffer "
"interface.  On success, returns ``0``, sets *buffer* to the memory location "
"and *buffer_len* to the buffer length.  Returns ``-1`` and sets a "
":exc:`TypeError` on error."

"Returns a pointer to a read-only memory location containing arbitrary data. "
"The *obj* argument must support the single-segment readable buffer "
"interface.  On success, returns ``0``, sets *buffer* to the memory location "
"and *buffer_len* to the buffer length.  Returns ``-1`` and sets a "
":exc:`TypeError` on error."

"Returns ``1`` if *o* supports the single-segment readable buffer interface. "
"Otherwise returns ``0``.  This function always succeeds."

"Note that this function tries to get and release a buffer, and exceptions "
"which occur while calling corresponding functions will get suppressed. To "
"get error reporting use :c:func:`PyObject_GetBuffer()` instead."

"Returns a pointer to a writable memory location.  The *obj* argument must "
"support the single-segment, character buffer interface.  On success, returns"
" ``0``, sets *buffer* to the memory location and *buffer_len* to the buffer "
"length.  Returns ``-1`` and sets a :exc:`TypeError` on error."
