"This is a simplified interface to :c:func:`PyImport_ImportModuleEx` below, "
"leaving the *globals* and *locals* arguments set to ``NULL`` and *level* set"
" to 0.  When the *name* argument contains a dot (when it specifies a "
"submodule of a package), the *fromlist* argument is set to the list "
"``['*']`` so that the return value is the named module rather than the top-"
"level package containing it as would otherwise be the case.  (Unfortunately,"
" this has an additional side effect when *name* in fact specifies a "
"subpackage instead of a submodule: the submodules specified in the package's"
" ``__all__`` variable are  loaded.)  Return a new reference to the imported "
"module, or ``NULL`` with an exception set on failure.  A failing import of a"
" module doesn't leave the module in :data:`sys.modules`."
