"Though tuples may seem similar to lists, they are often used in different "

msgid ""
"A special problem is the construction of tuples containing 0 or 1 items: the"
" syntax has some extra quirks to accommodate these.  Empty tuples are "
"constructed by an empty pair of parentheses; a tuple with one item is "
"constructed by following a value with a comma (it is not sufficient to "
"enclose a single value in parentheses). Ugly, but effective.  For example::"

"The statement ``t = 12345, 54321, 'hello!'`` is an example of *tuple "

msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/datastructures.rst:436

"This is called, appropriately enough, *sequence unpacking* and works for any"
" sequence on the right-hand side.  Sequence unpacking requires that there "
"are as many variables on the left side of the equals sign as there are "

"Another useful data type built into Python is the *dictionary* (see "
":ref:`typesmapping`). Dictionaries are sometimes found in other languages as"
" \"associative memories\" or \"associative arrays\".  Unlike sequences, "

" which can be any immutable type; strings and numbers can always be keys.  "
"Tuples can be used as keys if they contain only strings, numbers, or tuples;"
" if a tuple contains any mutable object either directly or indirectly, it "

msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/datastructures.rst:506
msgid ""
"It is best to think of a dictionary as a set of *key: value* pairs, with the"
" requirement that the keys are unique (within one dictionary). A pair of "
"braces creates an empty dictionary: ``{}``. Placing a comma-separated list "
"of key:value pairs within the braces adds initial key:value pairs to the "
"dictionary; this is also the way dictionaries are written on output."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/datastructures.rst:512

"The main operations on a dictionary are storing a value with some key and "

" extract a value using a non-existent key."
