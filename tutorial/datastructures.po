"Though tuples may seem similar to lists, they are often used in different "

"unpacking (see later in this section) or indexing (or even by attribute in "
"the case of :func:`namedtuples <collections.namedtuple>`). Lists are "
":term:`mutable`, and their elements are usually homogeneous and are accessed"
" by iterating over the list."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/datastructures.rst:416
msgid ""
"A special problem is the construction of tuples containing 0 or 1 items: the"
" syntax has some extra quirks to accommodate these.  Empty tuples are "
"constructed by an empty pair of parentheses; a tuple with one item is "
"constructed by following a value with a comma (it is not sufficient to "
"enclose a single value in parentheses). Ugly, but effective.  For example::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/datastructures.rst:431
msgid ""
"The statement ``t = 12345, 54321, 'hello!'`` is an example of *tuple "

msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/datastructures.rst:437
msgid ""
"This is called, appropriately enough, *sequence unpacking* and works for any"
" sequence on the right-hand side.  Sequence unpacking requires that there "
"are as many variables on the left side of the equals sign as there are "

"Curly braces or the :func:`set` function can be used to create sets.  Note: "

msgid ""
"Another useful data type built into Python is the *dictionary* (see "
":ref:`typesmapping`). Dictionaries are sometimes found in other languages as"
" \"associative memories\" or \"associative arrays\".  Unlike sequences, "
"which are indexed by a range of numbers, dictionaries are indexed by *keys*,"
" which can be any immutable type; strings and numbers can always be keys.  "
"Tuples can be used as keys if they contain only strings, numbers, or tuples;"
" if a tuple contains any mutable object either directly or indirectly, it "
"cannot be used as a key. You can't use lists as keys, since lists can be "

msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/datastructures.rst:507
msgid ""
"It is best to think of a dictionary as a set of *key: value* pairs, with the"
" requirement that the keys are unique (within one dictionary). A pair of "
"braces creates an empty dictionary: ``{}``. Placing a comma-separated list "
"of key:value pairs within the braces adds initial key:value pairs to the "
"dictionary; this is also the way dictionaries are written on output."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/datastructures.rst:513

"The main operations on a dictionary are storing a value with some key and "
"extracting the value given the key.  It is also possible to delete a "

" extract a value using a non-existent key."

"Performing ``list(d)`` on a dictionary returns a list of all the keys used "
