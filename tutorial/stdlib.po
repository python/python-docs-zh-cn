"Be sure to use the ``import os`` style instead of ``from os import *``.  "
"This will keep :func:`os.open` from shadowing the built-in :func:`open` "
"function which operates much differently."

"Common utility scripts often need to process command line arguments. These "

"The :mod:`getopt` module processes *sys.argv* using the conventions of the "

"The :mod:`sys` module also has attributes for *stdin*, *stdout*, and "

#: ../../tutorial/stdlib.rst:242
msgid ""
"Some Python users develop a deep interest in knowing the relative "

#: ../../tutorial/stdlib.rst:246
msgid ""
"For example, it may be tempting to use the tuple packing and unpacking "
"feature instead of the traditional approach to swapping arguments. The "
":mod:`timeit` module quickly demonstrates a modest performance advantage::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/stdlib.rst:256

"In contrast to :mod:`timeit`'s fine level of granularity, the :mod:`profile`"

"development process."

#: ../../tutorial/stdlib.rst:270
msgid ""
"The :mod:`doctest` module provides a tool for scanning a module and "
"validating tests embedded in a program's docstrings.  Test construction is "
"as simple as cutting-and-pasting a typical call along with its results into "
"the docstring. This improves the documentation by providing the user with an"
" example and it allows the doctest module to make sure the code remains true"
" to the documentation::"

#: ../../tutorial/stdlib.rst:288

"The :mod:`unittest` module is not as effortless as the :mod:`doctest` "

"The :mod:`xmlrpc.client` and :mod:`xmlrpc.server` modules make implementing "
"remote procedure calls into an almost trivial task.  Despite the modules "

msgid ""
"The :mod:`email` package is a library for managing email messages, including"
" MIME and other RFC 2822-based message documents. Unlike :mod:`smtplib` and "
":mod:`poplib` which actually send and receive messages, the email package "
"has a complete toolset for building or decoding complex message structures "
"(including attachments) and for implementing internet encoding and header "
"protocols."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/stdlib.rst:326
msgid ""
"The :mod:`json` package provides robust support for parsing this popular "
"data interchange format.  The :mod:`csv` module supports direct reading and "
"writing of files in Comma-Separated Value format, commonly supported by "
"databases and spreadsheets.  XML processing is supported by the "
":mod:`xml.etree.ElementTree`, :mod:`xml.dom` and :mod:`xml.sax` packages. "
"Together, these modules and packages greatly simplify data interchange "
"between Python applications and other tools."
