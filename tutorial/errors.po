"Until now error messages haven't been more than mentioned, but if you have "
"tried out the examples you have probably seen some.  There are (at least) "
"two distinguishable kinds of errors: *syntax errors* and *exceptions*."

"Syntax errors, also known as parsing errors, are perhaps the most common "

msgid ""
"The parser repeats the offending line and displays a little 'arrow' pointing"
" at the earliest point in the line where the error was detected.  The error "
"is caused by (or at least detected at) the token *preceding* the arrow: in "
"the example, the error is detected at the function :func:`print`, since a "
"colon (``':'``) is missing before it.  File name and line number are printed"
" so you know where to look in case the input came from a script."

"Even if a statement or expression is syntactically correct, it may cause an "
"error when an attempt is made to execute it. Errors detected during "
"execution are called *exceptions* and are not unconditionally fatal: you "
"will soon learn how to handle them in Python programs.  Most exceptions are "
"not handled by programs, however, and result in error messages as shown "
"here::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/errors.rst:58
msgid ""
"The last line of the error message indicates what happened. Exceptions come "
"in different types, and the type is printed as part of the message: the "
"types in the example are :exc:`ZeroDivisionError`, :exc:`NameError` and "
":exc:`TypeError`. The string printed as the exception type is the name of "
"the built-in exception that occurred.  This is true for all built-in "
"exceptions, but need not be true for user-defined exceptions (although it is"
" a useful convention). Standard exception names are built-in identifiers "
"(not reserved keywords)."

"It is possible to write programs that handle selected exceptions. Look at "
"the following example, which asks the user for input until a valid integer "
"has been entered, but allows the user to interrupt the program (using "
":kbd:`Control-C` or whatever the operating system supports); note that a "
"user-generated interruption is signalled by raising the "
":exc:`KeyboardInterrupt` exception. ::"

"If an exception occurs during execution of the try clause, the rest of the "

"A :keyword:`try` statement may have more than one except clause, to specify "
"handlers for different exceptions.  At most one handler will be executed. "
"Handlers only handle exceptions that occur in the corresponding try clause, "
"not in other handlers of the same :keyword:`try` statement.  An except "
"clause may name multiple exceptions as a parenthesized tuple, for example::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A class in an :keyword:`except` clause is compatible with an exception if it"
" is the same class or a base class thereof (but not the other way around ---"
" an except clause listing a derived class is not compatible with a base "
"class).  For example, the following code will print B, C, D in that order::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/errors.rst:147
msgid ""
"Note that if the except clauses were reversed (with ``except B`` first), it "
"would have printed B, B, B --- the first matching except clause is "
"triggered."

msgid ""
"The last except clause may omit the exception name(s), to serve as a "
"wildcard. Use this with extreme caution, since it is easy to mask a real "
"programming error in this way!  It can also be used to print an error "
"message and then re-raise the exception (allowing a caller to handle the "
"exception as well)::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/errors.rst:169
msgid ""
"The :keyword:`try` ... :keyword:`except` statement has an optional *else "
"clause*, which, when present, must follow all except clauses.  It is useful "
"for code that must be executed if the try clause does not raise an "
"exception.  For example::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/errors.rst:183
msgid ""
"The use of the :keyword:`else` clause is better than adding additional code "
"to the :keyword:`try` clause because it avoids accidentally catching an "

":keyword:`try` ... :keyword:`except` statement."

"When an exception occurs, it may have an associated value, also known as the"
" exception's *argument*. The presence and type of the argument depend on the"

#: ../../tutorial/errors.rst:192
msgid ""
"The except clause may specify a variable after the exception name.  The "
"variable is bound to an exception instance with the arguments stored in "
"``instance.args``.  For convenience, the exception instance defines "
":meth:`__str__` so the arguments can be printed directly without having to "
"reference ``.args``.  One may also instantiate an exception first before "
"raising it and add any attributes to it as desired. ::"

"The sole argument to :keyword:`raise` indicates the exception to be raised. "
"This must be either an exception instance or an exception class (a class "

"Programs may name their own exceptions by creating a new exception class "

msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/errors.rst:279
msgid ""
"Exception classes can be defined which do anything any other class can do, "
"but are usually kept simple, often only offering a number of attributes that"
" allow information about the error to be extracted by handlers for the "
"exception.  When creating a module that can raise several distinct errors, a"
" common practice is to create a base class for exceptions defined by that "
"module, and subclass that to create specific exception classes for different"
" error conditions::"

msgid ""
"A *finally clause* is always executed before leaving the :keyword:`try` "

":keyword:`except` clause (or it has occurred in an :keyword:`except` or "
":keyword:`else` clause), it is re-raised after the :keyword:`finally` clause"

"more complicated example::"

"As you can see, the :keyword:`finally` clause is executed in any event.  The"

":keyword:`finally` clause has been executed."

"The problem with this code is that it leaves the file open for an "

"correctly. ::"
