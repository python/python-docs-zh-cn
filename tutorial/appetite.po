"You could write a Unix shell script or Windows batch files for some of these"
" tasks, but shell scripts are best at moving around files and changing text "
"data, not well-suited for GUI applications or games. You could write a "

"对于这些任务，你也可以写 Unix shell 脚本或者 Windows 批处理完成，但是 shell 脚本最擅长移动文件和替换文本，并不适合 GUI "

"Python is simple to use, but it is a real programming language, offering "
"much more structure and support for large programs than shell scripts or "
"batch files can offer.  On the other hand, Python also offers much more "
"error checking than C, and, being a *very-high-level language*, it has high-"
"level data types built in, such as flexible arrays and dictionaries.  "
"Because of its more general data types Python is applicable to a much larger"
" problem domain than Awk or even Perl, yet many things are at least as easy "
"in Python as in those languages."

"Python 很容易使用，但它是一种真正的编程语言，提供了很多数据结构，也支持大型程序，远超 shell 脚本或批处理文件的功能。Python 还提供比"

"Python allows you to split your program into modules that can be reused in "
"other Python programs.  It comes with a large collection of standard modules"
" that you can use as the basis of your programs --- or as examples to start "
"learning to program in Python.  Some of these modules provide things like "
"file I/O, system calls, sockets, and even interfaces to graphical user "
"interface toolkits like Tk."

"Python 允许你将程序划分为能在其他的 Python "

"Python is an interpreted language, which can save you considerable time "
"during program development because no compilation and linking is necessary."
"  The interpreter can be used interactively, which makes it easy to "
"experiment with features of the language, to write throw-away programs, or "
"to test functions during bottom-up program development. It is also a handy "
"desk calculator."
msgstr ""
"Python "
"是一种解释型语言，在程序开发阶段可以为你节省大量时间，因为不需要编译和链接。解释器可以交互式使用，这样就可以方便地尝试语言特性，写一些一次性的程序，或者在自底向上的程序开发中测试功能。它也是一个顺手的桌面计算器。"
