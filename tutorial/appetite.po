"如果你是专业的软件开发人员，你可能需要编写一些C/C++/Java库，但总觉得通常的开发的流程（编写、编译、测试、再次编译等）太慢了。可能给这样的库写一组测试，就是很麻烦的工作了。或许你写了个软件，可以支持插件扩展语言，但你不想为了自己这一个应用，专门设计和实现一种新语言了。"

"You could write a Unix shell script or Windows batch files for some of these"

"对于这些任务，你也可以写Unix脚本或者Windows批处理完成，但是shell脚本最擅长移动文件和替换文本，并不适合GUI界面或者游戏开发。你可以写一个C/C++/Java程序，但是可能第一版本的草稿都要很长的开发时间。Python的使用则更加简单，可以在Windows，Mac"

"Python is simple to use, but it is a real programming language, offering "
"much more structure and support for large programs than shell scripts or "
"batch files can offer.  On the other hand, Python also offers much more "
"error checking than C, and, being a *very-high-level language*, it has high-"
"level data types built in, such as flexible arrays and dictionaries.  "
"Because of its more general data types Python is applicable to a much larger"
" problem domain than Awk or even Perl, yet many things are at least as easy "
"in Python as in those languages."
msgstr ""
"Python很容易使用，但它是一种真正的编程语言，提供了很多数据结构，也支持大型程序，远超shell脚本或批处理文件的功能。Python还提供比C语言更多的错误检查，而且作为一种“超高级语言”，它有高级的内置数据类型，比如灵活的数组和字典。正因为这些更加通用的数据类型，Python能够应付更多的问题，超过Awk甚至Perl，而且很多东西在Python中至少和那些语言同样简单。"

"Python allows you to split your program into modules that can be reused in "
"other Python programs.  It comes with a large collection of standard modules"
" that you can use as the basis of your programs --- or as examples to start "
"learning to program in Python.  Some of these modules provide things like "
"file I/O, system calls, sockets, and even interfaces to graphical user "
"interface toolkits like Tk."
msgstr ""
"Python 允许你划分程序模块，在其他的 Python 程序中重用。它内置了很多的标准模块，你可以在此基础上开发程序——也可以作为例子，开始学习 "

"Python is an interpreted language, which can save you considerable time "
"during program development because no compilation and linking is necessary."
"  The interpreter can be used interactively, which makes it easy to "
"experiment with features of the language, to write throw-away programs, or "
"to test functions during bottom-up program development. It is also a handy "
"desk calculator."
msgstr ""
"Python是一种解释型语言，在程序开发阶段可以为你节省大量时间，因为不需要编译和链接。解释器可以交互式使用，这样就可以方便地尝试语言特性，写一些一次性的程序，或者在自底向上的程序开发中测试功能。它也是一个顺手的桌面计算器。"

"Python is *extensible*: if you know how to program in C it is easy to add a "
"new built-in function or module to the interpreter, either to perform "
"critical operations at maximum speed, or to link Python programs to "
"libraries that may only be available in binary form (such as a vendor-"
"specific graphics library). Once you are really hooked, you can link the "
"Python interpreter into an application written in C and use it as an "
"extension or command language for that application."
msgstr ""
"Python是“可扩展的”：如果你知道怎么写C语言程序，就能很容易地给解释器添加新的内置函数或模块，不论是让关键的程序以最高速度运行，还是把Python程序链接到只提供预编译程序的库（比如硬件相关的图形库）。一旦你真正链接上了，就能在Python解释器中扩展或者控制C语言编写的应用了。"
