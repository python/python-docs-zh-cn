"You could write a Unix shell script or Windows batch files for some of these"

" and Unix operating systems, and will help you get the job done more "

"Python is simple to use, but it is a real programming language, offering "
"much more structure and support for large programs than shell scripts or "
"batch files can offer.  On the other hand, Python also offers much more "
"error checking than C, and, being a *very-high-level language*, it has high-"
"level data types built in, such as flexible arrays and dictionaries.  "
"Because of its more general data types Python is applicable to a much larger"
" problem domain than Awk or even Perl, yet many things are at least as easy "
"in Python as in those languages."

"Python 虽然简单易用，但它可是真正的编程语言，提供了大量的数据结构，也支持开发大型程序，远超 shell 脚本或批处理文件；Python "

"Python allows you to split your program into modules that can be reused in "
"other Python programs.  It comes with a large collection of standard modules"
" that you can use as the basis of your programs --- or as examples to start "

"file I/O, system calls, sockets, and even interfaces to graphical user "
"interface toolkits like Tk."

"Python 支持把程序分割为模块，以便在其他 Python 程序中复用。它还内置了大量标准模块，作为开发程序的基础 —— 您还可以把这些模块当作学习 "

"Python is an interpreted language, which can save you considerable time "
"during program development because no compilation and linking is necessary."
"  The interpreter can be used interactively, which makes it easy to "
"experiment with features of the language, to write throw-away programs, or "
"to test functions during bottom-up program development. It is also a handy "
"desk calculator."

"Python "
"是一种解释型语言，不需要编译和链接，可以节省大量开发时间。它的解释器实现了交互式操作，轻而易举地就能试用各种语言功能，编写临时程序，或在自底向上的程序开发中测试功能。同时，它还是一个超好用的计算器。"

"Python is *extensible*: if you know how to program in C it is easy to add a "
"new built-in function or module to the interpreter, either to perform "
"critical operations at maximum speed, or to link Python programs to "

"specific graphics library). Once you are really hooked, you can link the "
"Python interpreter into an application written in C and use it as an "
"extension or command language for that application."
