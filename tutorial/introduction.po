" the start of a line or following whitespace or code, but not within a "
"string literal.  A hash character within a string literal is just a hash "
"character. Since comments are to clarify code and are not interpreted by "
"Python, they may be omitted when typing in examples."

"In addition to :class:`int` and :class:`float`, Python supports other types "

"In the interactive interpreter, the output string is enclosed in quotes and "
"special characters are escaped with backslashes.  While this might sometimes"
" look different from the input (the enclosing quotes could change), the two "
"strings are equivalent.  The string is enclosed in double quotes if the "
"string contains a single quote and no double quotes, otherwise it is "
"enclosed in single quotes.  The :func:`print` function produces a more "
"readable output, by omitting the enclosing quotes and by printing escaped "
"and special characters::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/introduction.rst:173
msgid ""
"If you don't want characters prefaced by ``\\`` to be interpreted as special"
" characters, you can use *raw strings* by adding an ``r`` before the first "
"quote::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/introduction.rst:183
msgid ""
"String literals can span multiple lines.  One way is using triple-quotes: "
"``\"\"\"...\"\"\"`` or ``'''...'''``.  End of lines are automatically "
"included in the string, but it's possible to prevent this by adding a ``\\``"
" at the end of the line.  The following example::"

"Slice indices have useful defaults; an omitted first index defaults to zero,"

"One way to remember how slices work is to think of the indices as pointing "
"*between* characters, with the left edge of the first character numbered 0. "

"index *n*, for example::"
msgstr ""

"The first row of numbers gives the position of the indices 0...6 in the "

"The *body* of the loop is *indented*: indentation is Python's way of "
