" look different from the input (the enclosing quotes could change), the two "
"strings are equivalent.  The string is enclosed in double quotes if the "
"string contains a single quote and no double quotes, otherwise it is "
"enclosed in single quotes.  The :func:`print` function produces a more "
"readable output, by omitting the enclosing quotes and by printing escaped "
"and special characters::"

"If you don't want characters prefaced by ``\\`` to be interpreted as special"

"String literals can span multiple lines.  One way is using triple-quotes: "

"One way to remember how slices work is to think of the indices as pointing "
