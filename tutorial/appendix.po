"When an error occurs, the interpreter prints an error message and a stack "
"trace. In interactive mode, it then returns to the primary prompt; when "
"input came from a file, it exits with a nonzero exit status after printing "
"the stack trace. (Exceptions handled by an :keyword:`except` clause in a "
":keyword:`try` statement are not errors in this context.)  Some errors are "
"unconditionally fatal and cause an exit with a nonzero exit; this applies to"
" internal inconsistencies and some cases of running out of memory.  All "
"error messages are written to the standard error stream; normal output from "
"executed commands is written to standard output."

"Typing the interrupt character (usually :kbd:`Control-C` or :kbd:`Delete`) "
"to the primary or secondary prompt cancels the input and returns to the "
"primary prompt. [#]_ Typing an interrupt while a command is executing raises"
" the :exc:`KeyboardInterrupt` exception, which may be handled by a "
":keyword:`try` statement."

"On Windows systems, there is no notion of an \"executable mode\".  The "
"Python installer automatically associates ``.py`` files with ``python.exe`` "
"so that a double-click on a Python file will run it as a script.  The "
"extension can also be ``.pyw``, in that case, the console window that "
"normally appears is suppressed."

msgid ""
"When you use Python interactively, it is frequently handy to have some "
"standard commands executed every time the interpreter is started.  You can "
"do this by setting an environment variable named :envvar:`PYTHONSTARTUP` to "
"the name of a file containing your start-up commands.  This is similar to "
"the :file:`.profile` feature of the Unix shells."

"This file is only read in interactive sessions, not when Python reads "
"commands from a script, and not when :file:`/dev/tty` is given as the "
"explicit source of commands (which otherwise behaves like an interactive "
"session).  It is executed in the same namespace where interactive commands "
"are executed, so that objects that it defines or imports can be used without"
" qualification in the interactive session. You can also change the prompts "
"``sys.ps1`` and ``sys.ps2`` in this file."

"If you want to read an additional start-up file from the current directory, "

"Python provides two hooks to let you customize it: :mod:`sitecustomize` and "

"Now you can create a file named :file:`usercustomize.py` in that directory "

":mod:`sitecustomize` works in the same way, but is typically created by an "
