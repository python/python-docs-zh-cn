"Classes provide a means of bundling data and functionality together.  "
"Creating a new class creates a new *type* of object, allowing new "

"Compared with other programming languages, Python's class mechanism adds "
"classes with a minimum of new syntax and semantics.  It is a mixture of the "
"class mechanisms found in C++ and Modula-3.  Python classes provide all the "
"standard features of Object Oriented Programming: the class inheritance "
"mechanism allows multiple base classes, a derived class can override any "
"methods of its base class or classes, and a method can call the method of a "
"base class with the same name.  Objects can contain arbitrary amounts and "
"kinds of data.  As is true for modules, classes partake of the dynamic "
"nature of Python: they are created at runtime, and can be modified further "

"In C++ terminology, normally class members (including the data members) are "
"*public* (except see below :ref:`tut-private`), and all member functions are"

"object's members from its methods: the method function is declared with an "
"explicit first argument representing the object, which is provided "
"implicitly by the call.  As in Smalltalk, classes themselves are objects.  "
"This provides semantics for importing and renaming.  Unlike C++ and "
"Modula-3, built-in types can be used as base classes for extension by the "

"Objects have individuality, and multiple names (in multiple scopes) can be "
"bound to the same object.  This is known as aliasing in other languages.  "
"This is usually not appreciated on a first glance at Python, and can be "
"safely ignored when dealing with immutable basic types (numbers, strings, "
"tuples).  However, aliasing has a possibly surprising effect on the "
"semantics of Python code involving mutable objects such as lists, "
"dictionaries, and most other types. This is usually used to the benefit of "
"the program, since aliases behave like pointers in some respects.  For "
"example, passing an object is cheap since only a pointer is passed by the "
"implementation; and if a function modifies an object passed as an argument, "
"the caller will see the change --- this eliminates the need for two "
"different argument passing mechanisms as in Pascal."

"A *namespace* is a mapping from names to objects.  Most namespaces are "
"currently implemented as Python dictionaries, but that's normally not "
"noticeable in any way (except for performance), and it may change in the "
"future.  Examples of namespaces are: the set of built-in names (containing "
"functions such as :func:`abs`, and built-in exception names); the global "
"names in a module; and the local names in a function invocation.  In a sense"
" the set of attributes of an object also form a namespace.  The important "
"thing to know about namespaces is that there is absolutely no relation "
"between names in different namespaces; for instance, two different modules "

"by the top-level invocation of the interpreter, either read from a script "

"In fact, it is slightly more complex than that; the method resolution order "

"Dynamic ordering is necessary because all cases of multiple inheritance "
"exhibit one or more diamond relationships (where at least one of the parent "
"classes can be accessed through multiple paths from the bottommost class).  "
"For example, all classes inherit from :class:`object`, so any case of "
"multiple inheritance provides more than one path to reach :class:`object`.  "
"To keep the base classes from being accessed more than once, the dynamic "
"algorithm linearizes the search order in a way that preserves the left-to-"
"right ordering specified in each class, that calls each parent only once, "
"and that is monotonic (meaning that a class can be subclassed without "
"affecting the precedence order of its parents). Taken together, these "
"properties make it possible to design reliable and extensible classes with "
"multiple inheritance.  For more detail, see "
