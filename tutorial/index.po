"Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient "
"high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to object-"
"oriented programming. Python's elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together "
"with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and "
"rapid application development in many areas on most platforms."

"For a description of standard objects and modules, see :ref:`library-index`."
" :ref:`reference-index` gives a more formal definition of the language.  To "
