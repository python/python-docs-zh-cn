"Some versions of the Python interpreter support editing of the current input"
" line and history substitution, similar to facilities found in the Korn "
"shell and the GNU Bash shell.  This is implemented using the `GNU Readline`_"
" library, which supports various styles of editing.  This library has its "
"own documentation which we won't duplicate here."

msgid ""
"Completion of variable and module names is :ref:`automatically enabled "
"<rlcompleter-config>` at interpreter startup so that the :kbd:`Tab` key "
"invokes the completion function; it looks at Python statement names, the "
"current local variables, and the available module names.  For dotted "
"expressions such as ``string.a``, it will evaluate the expression up to the "
"final ``'.'`` and then suggest completions from the attributes of the "
"resulting object.  Note that this may execute application-defined code if an"
" object with a :meth:`__getattr__` method is part of the expression.  The "
"default configuration also saves your history into a file named "
":file:`.python_history` in your user directory. The history will be "
"available again during the next interactive interpreter session."

msgid ""
"This facility is an enormous step forward compared to earlier versions of "
"the interpreter; however, some wishes are left: It would be nice if the "
"proper indentation were suggested on continuation lines (the parser knows if"
" an indent token is required next).  The completion mechanism might use the "
"interpreter's symbol table.  A command to check (or even suggest) matching "
"parentheses, quotes, etc., would also be useful."

msgid ""
"One alternative enhanced interactive interpreter that has been around for "
"quite some time is IPython_, which features tab completion, object "
"exploration and advanced history management.  It can also be thoroughly "
"customized and embedded into other applications.  Another similar enhanced "
"interactive environment is bpython_."
