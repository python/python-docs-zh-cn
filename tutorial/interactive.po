"Some versions of the Python interpreter support editing of the current input"
" line and history substitution, similar to facilities found in the Korn "
"shell and the GNU Bash shell.  This is implemented using the `GNU Readline`_"
" library, which supports various styles of editing.  This library has its "
"own documentation which we won't duplicate here."
msgstr ""
"某些版本的 Python 解释器支持编辑当前输入行和编辑历史记录，类似 Korn shell 和 GNU Bash shell 的功能 。这个功能使用了"
" `GNU Readline`_ 来实现，一个支持多种编辑方式的库。这个库有它自己的文档，在这里我们就不重复说明了。"

"Completion of variable and module names is :ref:`automatically enabled "
"<rlcompleter-config>` at interpreter startup so that the :kbd:`Tab` key "
"invokes the completion function; it looks at Python statement names, the "
"current local variables, and the available module names.  For dotted "
"expressions such as ``string.a``, it will evaluate the expression up to the "
"final ``'.'`` and then suggest completions from the attributes of the "
"resulting object.  Note that this may execute application-defined code if an"
" object with a :meth:`~object.__getattr__` method is part of the expression."
"  The default configuration also saves your history into a file named "
":file:`.python_history` in your user directory. The history will be "
"available again during the next interactive interpreter session."
msgstr ""
"在解释器启动的时候变量和模块名补全功能将 :ref:`自动启用 <rlcompleter-config>` 以便在按下 :kbd:`Tab` "
"键时唤起补全函数；它会查找 Python 语句名称、当前局部变量和可用的模块名称。 对于带点号的表达式如 "
"``string.a``，它会对该表达式最后一个 ``'.'`` 之前的部分求值然后根据结果对象的属性给出补全建议。 请注意如果具有 "
":meth:`~object.__getattr__` 方法的对象是该表达式的一部分这可能会执行应用程序定义的代码。 "
"默认配置还会将你的编辑历史保存到你的用户目录下名为 :file:`.python_history` 的文件。 "
"该历史在下一次交互式解释器会话期间将继续可用。"

msgid ""
"This facility is an enormous step forward compared to earlier versions of "
"the interpreter; however, some wishes are left: It would be nice if the "
"proper indentation were suggested on continuation lines (the parser knows if"
" an :data:`~token.INDENT` token is required next).  The completion mechanism"
" might use the interpreter's symbol table.  A command to check (or even "
"suggest) matching parentheses, quotes, etc., would also be useful."

"One alternative enhanced interactive interpreter that has been around for "
"quite some time is IPython_, which features tab completion, object "
"exploration and advanced history management.  It can also be thoroughly "
"customized and embedded into other applications.  Another similar enhanced "
"interactive environment is bpython_."

"补全，探索对象和高级历史记录管理功能。它还可以彻底定制并嵌入到其他应用程序中。另一个相似的增强型交互式环境是 bpython_。"
