"Floating-point numbers are represented in computer hardware as base 2 "
"(binary) fractions.  For example, the **decimal** fraction ``0.125`` has "
"value 1/10 + 2/100 + 5/1000, and in the same way the **binary** fraction "
"``0.001`` has value 0/2 + 0/4 + 1/8. These two fractions have identical "
"values, the only real difference being that the first is written in base 10 "
"fractional notation, and the second in base 2."

"Unfortunately, most decimal fractions cannot be represented exactly as "
"binary fractions.  A consequence is that, in general, the decimal floating-"
"point numbers you enter are only approximated by the binary floating-point "
"numbers actually stored in the machine."

"Stop at any finite number of bits, and you get an approximation.  On most "
"machines today, floats are approximated using a binary fraction with the "
"numerator using the first 53 bits starting with the most significant bit and"
" with the denominator as a power of two.  In the case of 1/10, the binary "
"fraction is ``3602879701896397 / 2 ** 55`` which is close to but not exactly"

"Many users are not aware of the approximation because of the way values are "
"displayed.  Python only prints a decimal approximation to the true decimal "

"stored for 0.1, it would have to display ::"

"Interestingly, there are many different decimal numbers that share the same "
"nearest approximate binary fraction.  For example, the numbers ``0.1`` and "

"``0.1000000000000000055511151231257827021181583404541015625`` are all "
"approximated by ``3602879701896397 / 2 ** 55``.  Since all of these decimal "

"Historically, the Python prompt and built-in :func:`repr` function would "
"choose the one with 17 significant digits, ``0.10000000000000001``.   "

"As that says near the end, \"there are no easy answers.\"  Still, don't be "

"order of no more than 1 part in 2\\*\\*53 per operation.  That's more than "
