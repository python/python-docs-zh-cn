"The setup script is the centre of all activity in building, distributing, "

"saw in section :ref:`distutils-simple-example` above, the setup script "

"There are only two differences between this and the trivial one-file "

"of dozen modules split into (so far) two packages; an explicit list of every"

"The ``packages`` option tells the Distutils to process (build, distribute, "
"install, etc.) all pure Python modules found in each package mentioned in "
"the ``packages`` list.  In order to do this, of course, there has to be a "
"correspondence between package names and directories in the filesystem.  The"
" default correspondence is the most obvious one, i.e. package "
":mod:`distutils` is found in the directory :file:`distutils` relative to the"
" distribution root. Thus, when you say ``packages = ['foo']`` in your setup "
"script, you are promising that the Distutils will find a file "
":file:`foo/__init__.py` (which might be spelled differently on your system, "
"but you get the idea) relative to the directory where your setup script "
"lives.  If you break this promise, the Distutils will issue a warning but "
"still process the broken package anyway."

"If you use a different convention to lay out your source directory, that's "
"no problem: you just have to supply the ``package_dir`` option to tell the "
"Distutils about your convention.  For example, say you keep all Python "
"source under :file:`lib`, so that modules in the \"root package\" (i.e., not"
" in any package at all) are in :file:`lib`, modules in the :mod:`foo` "
"package are in :file:`lib/foo`, and so forth.  Then you would put ::"

":file:`lib/bar/__init__.py`.  (Keep in mind that although ``package_dir`` "
