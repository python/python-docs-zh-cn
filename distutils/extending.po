"Distutils can be extended in various ways.  Most extensions take the form of"
" new commands or replacements for existing commands.  New commands may be "
"written to support new types of platform-specific packaging, for example, "
"while replacements for existing commands may be made to modify details of "
"how the command operates on a package."

#: ../../distutils/extending.rst:15
msgid ""
"Most extensions of the distutils are made within :file:`setup.py` scripts "
"that want to modify existing commands; many simply add a few file extensions"
" that should be copied into packages in addition to :file:`.py` files as a "
"convenience."

"Most distutils command implementations are subclasses of the "
":class:`distutils.cmd.Command` class.  New commands may directly inherit "
"from :class:`Command`, while replacements often derive from :class:`Command`"
" indirectly, directly subclassing the command they are replacing.  Commands "
"are required to derive from :class:`Command`."

"There are different ways to integrate new command implementations into "
"distutils.  The most difficult is to lobby for the inclusion of the new "
"features in distutils itself, and wait for (and require) a version of Python"
" that provides that support.  This is really hard for many reasons."

"The most common, and possibly the most reasonable for most needs, is to "
"include the new implementations with your :file:`setup.py` script, and cause"
" the :func:`distutils.core.setup` function use them::"

"This approach is most valuable if the new implementations must be used to "
"use a particular package, as everyone interested in the package will need to"
" have the new command implementation."

"Beginning with Python 2.4, a third option is available, intended to allow "
"new commands to be added which can support existing :file:`setup.py` scripts"
" without requiring modifications to the Python installation.  This is "
"expected to allow third-party extensions to provide support for additional "
"packaging systems, but the commands can be used for anything distutils "
"commands can be used for.  A new configuration option, ``command_packages`` "
"(command-line option :option:`!--command-packages`), can be used to specify "
"additional packages to be searched for modules implementing commands.  Like "
"all distutils options, this can be specified on the command line or in a "
"configuration file.  This option can only be set in the ``[global]`` section"
" of a configuration file, or before any commands on the command line.  If "
"set in a configuration file, it can be overridden from the command line; "
"setting it to an empty string on the command line causes the default to be "
"used.  This should never be set in a configuration file provided with a "
"package."

"This new option can be used to add any number of packages to the list of "
"packages searched for command implementations; multiple package names should"
" be separated by commas.  When not specified, the search is only performed "
"in the :mod:`distutils.command` package.  When :file:`setup.py` is run with "
"the option ``--command-packages distcmds,buildcmds``, however, the packages "
":mod:`distutils.command`, :mod:`distcmds`, and :mod:`buildcmds` will be "
"searched in that order.  New commands are expected to be implemented in "
"modules of the same name as the command by classes sharing the same name.  "
"Given the example command line option above, the command "
":command:`bdist_openpkg` could be implemented by the class "
":class:`distcmds.bdist_openpkg.bdist_openpkg` or "
":class:`buildcmds.bdist_openpkg.bdist_openpkg`."

"Commands that create distributions (files in the :file:`dist/` directory) "
"need to add ``(command, filename)`` pairs to "
"``self.distribution.dist_files`` so that :command:`upload` can upload it to "
"PyPI.  The *filename* in the pair contains no path information, only the "
"name of the file itself.  In dry-run mode, pairs should still be added to "
"represent what would have been created."
