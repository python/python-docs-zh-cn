"Not all module developers have access to a multitude of platforms, so it's "
"not always feasible to expect them to create a multitude of built "
"distributions.  It is hoped that a class of intermediaries, called "
"*packagers*, will arise to address this need.  Packagers will take source "
"distributions released by module developers, build them on one or more "
"platforms, and release the resulting built distributions.  Thus, users on "
"the most popular platforms will be able to install most popular Python "
"module distributions in the most natural way for their platform, without "
"having to run a single setup script or compile a line of code."
