"The previous chapters discussed how to extend Python, that is, how to extend"
" the functionality of Python by attaching a library of C functions to it.  "
"It is also possible to do it the other way around: enrich your C/C++ "
"application by embedding Python in it.  Embedding provides your application "
"with the ability to implement some of the functionality of your application "
"in Python rather than C or C++. This can be used for many purposes; one "
"example would be to allow users to tailor the application to their needs by "
"writing some scripts in Python.  You can also use it yourself if some of the"
" functionality can be written in Python more easily."
msgstr ""
"前几章讨论了如何对 Python 进行扩展，也就是如何用 C 函数库 扩展 Python 的功能。反过来也是可以的：将 Python 嵌入到 C/C++"
" 应用程序中丰富其功能。这种嵌入可以让应用程序用 Python 来实现某些功能，而不是用 C 或 C++ 。用途会有很多；比如允许用户用 Python "
"编写一些脚本，以便定制应用程序满足需求。如果某些功能用 Python 编写起来更为容易，那么开发人员自己也能这么干。"

"Embedding Python is similar to extending it, but not quite.  The difference "
"is that when you extend Python, the main program of the application is still"
" the Python interpreter, while if you embed Python, the main program may "
"have nothing to do with Python --- instead, some parts of the application "
"occasionally call the Python interpreter to run some Python code."
msgstr ""
"Python 的嵌入类似于扩展，但不完全相同。不同之处在于，扩展 Python 时应用程序的主程序仍然是 Python 解释器，而嵌入 Python "
"时的主程序可能与 Python 完全无关——而是应用程序的某些部分偶尔会调用 Python 解释器来运行一些 Python 代码。"

"So if you are embedding Python, you are providing your own main program.  "
"One of the things this main program has to do is initialize the Python "
"interpreter.  At the very least, you have to call the function "
":c:func:`Py_Initialize`.  There are optional calls to pass command line "
"arguments to Python.  Then later you can call the interpreter from any part "
"of the application."
msgstr ""
"因此，若要嵌入 Python，就要提供自己的主程序。此主程序要做的事情之一就是初始化 Python 解释器。至少得调用函数 "
":c:func:`Py_Initialize`。还有些可选的调用可向 Python 传递命令行参数。之后即可从应用程序的任何地方调用解释器了。"

"There are several different ways to call the interpreter: you can pass a "
"string containing Python statements to :c:func:`PyRun_SimpleString`, or you "

"Python objects."

":c:func:`Py_FinalizeEx` call shuts the interpreter down, followed by the end"

"from another source, perhaps a text-editor routine, a file, or a database.  "

"脚本，打印出日期和时间。之后，调用 :c:func:`Py_FinalizeEx` 关闭解释器，程序结束。在真实的程序中，可能需要从其他来源获取 "
