"The C extension interface is specific to CPython, and extension modules do "

"avoid writing C extensions and preserve portability to other "

"functions or system calls, you should consider using the :mod:`ctypes` "
"module or the `cffi <https://cffi.readthedocs.io/>`_ library rather than "
"writing custom C code. These modules let you write Python code to interface "
"with C code and are more portable between implementations of Python than "
