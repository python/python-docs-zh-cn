"Python on iOS is unlike Python on desktop platforms. On a desktop platform, "
"Python is generally installed as a system resource that can be used by any "
"user of that computer. Users then interact with Python by running a "
":program:`python` executable and entering commands at an interactive prompt,"
" or by running a Python script."
msgstr ""
"在 iOS 上的 Python 不同于桌面平台上的 Python。 在桌面平台上，Python 通常是作为系统资源安装并可供该计算机上的任何用户使用。 "
"用户将通过运行 :program:`python` 可执行文件并在交互提示符下输入命令，或者通过运行 Python 脚本的方式与 Python "
"进行交互。"

#: ../../using/ios.rst:16
msgid ""
"On iOS, there is no concept of installing as a system resource. The only "
"unit of software distribution is an \"app\". There is also no console where "
"you could run a :program:`python` executable, or interact with a Python "
"REPL."

"As a result, the only way you can use Python on iOS is in embedded mode - "
"that is, by writing a native iOS application, and embedding a Python "
"interpreter using ``libPython``, and invoking Python code using the "
":ref:`Python embedding API <embedding>`. The full Python interpreter, the "
"standard library, and all your Python code is then packaged as a standalone "
"bundle that can be distributed via the iOS App Store."
msgstr ""
"因此，你在 iOS 上使用 Python 的唯一方式是嵌入模式 —— 也就是说，通过编写原生的 iOS 应用，并使用 ``libPython`` "
"嵌入一个 Python 解释器，然后使用 :ref:`Python 嵌入式 API <embedding>` 来发起调用 Python 代码。 完整的 "
"Python 解释器、标准库，以及所有 Python 代码都将被打包为可通过 iOS App Store 发布的独立软件包。"

" These projects manage the complexities associated with getting an iOS "
"project running, so you only need to deal with the Python code itself."

"The iOS App Store requires that *all* binary modules in an iOS app must be "

" name from the full import path of the module), with an ``Info.plist`` file "
"in the ``.framework`` directory identifying the binary as a framework. The "
"``foo.bar._whiz`` module would be represented in the original location with "
"a ``sources/foo/bar/_whiz.abi3.fwork`` marker file, containing the path "
"``Frameworks/foo.bar._whiz/foo.bar._whiz``. The framework would also contain"
