"Python on a Mac running macOS is in principle very similar to Python on any "

"On macOS 10.8-12.3, the Apple-provided build of Python is installed in "
":file:`/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework` and "
":file:`/usr/bin/python`, respectively. You should never modify or delete "
"these, as they are Apple-controlled and are used by Apple- or third-party "
"software.  Remember that if you choose to install a newer Python version "
"from python.org, you will have two different but functional Python "
"installations on your computer, so it will be important that your paths and "

"If you want to run Python scripts from the Terminal window command line or "

":program:`BBEdit` from Bare Bones Software (see "
