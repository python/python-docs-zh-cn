"macOS since version 10.8 comes with Python 2.7 pre-installed by Apple.  If "
"you wish, you are invited to install the most recent version of Python 3 "
"from the Python website (https://www.python.org).  A current \"universal "
"binary\" build of Python, which runs natively on the Mac's new Intel and "
"legacy PPC CPU's, is available there."

"A :file:`Python 3.9` folder in your :file:`Applications` folder. In here you"

"A framework :file:`/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework`, which includes the"

"The Apple-provided build of Python is installed in "
":file:`/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework` and "
":file:`/usr/bin/python`, respectively. You should never modify or delete "
"these, as they are Apple-controlled and are used by Apple- or third-party "
"software.  Remember that if you choose to install a newer Python version "
"from python.org, you will have two different but functional Python "
"installations on your computer, so it will be important that your paths and "
"usages are consistent with what you want to do."

":program:`BBEdit` or :program:`TextWrangler` from Bare Bones Software (see "
"http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/index.html) are good choices, as is"
