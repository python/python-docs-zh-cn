"An application written in Python does not necessarily require users to be "
"aware of that fact. The embedded distribution may be used in this case to "
"include a private version of Python in an install package. Depending on how "
"transparent it should be (or conversely, how professional it should appear),"
" there are two options."

#: ../../using/windows.rst:969
msgid ""
"Using a specialized executable as a launcher requires some coding, but "
"provides the most transparent experience for users. With a customized "
"launcher, there are no obvious indications that the program is running on "
"Python: icons can be customized, company and version information can be "
"specified, and file associations behave properly. In most cases, a custom "
"launcher should simply be able to call ``Py_Main`` with a hard-coded command"
" line."

#: ../../using/windows.rst:976

"The simpler approach is to provide a batch file or generated shortcut that "
"directly calls the ``python.exe`` or ``pythonw.exe`` with the required "
"command-line arguments. In this case, the application will appear to be "
"Python and not its actual name, and users may have trouble distinguishing it"
" from other running Python processes or file associations."
msgstr ""

#: ../../using/windows.rst:982
msgid ""
"With the latter approach, packages should be installed as directories "
"alongside the Python executable to ensure they are available on the path. "
"With the specialized launcher, packages can be located in other locations as"
" there is an opportunity to specify the search path before launching the "
"application."

"Applications written in native code often require some form of scripting "

" In general, the majority of the application is in native code, and some "
"part will either invoke ``python.exe`` or directly use ``python3.dll``. For "
"either case, extracting the embedded distribution to a subdirectory of the "
"application installation is sufficient to provide a loadable Python "
"interpreter."
