":pep:`451` adds the encapsulation of per-module import state in spec "
"objects.  It also off-loads most of the boilerplate responsibilities of "
"loaders back onto the import machinery.  These changes allow the deprecation"
" of several APIs in the import system and also addition of new methods to "
"finders and loaders."

"The importlib implementation avoids using the return value directly. "
"Instead, it gets the module object by looking the module name up in "
":data:`sys.modules`.  The indirect effect of this is that an imported module"
" may replace itself in :data:`sys.modules`.  This is implementation-specific"
" behavior that is not guaranteed to work in other Python implementations."
