"These functions cannot be used with complex numbers; use the functions of "
"the same name from the :mod:`cmath` module if you require support for "
"complex numbers.  The distinction between functions which support complex "
"numbers and those which don't is made since most users do not want to learn "
"quite as much mathematics as required to understand complex numbers.  "
"Receiving an exception instead of a complex result allows earlier detection "
"of the unexpected complex number used as a parameter, so that the programmer"
" can determine how and why it was generated in the first place."

"Return ``fmod(x, y)``, as defined by the platform C library. Note that the "
"Python expression ``x % y`` may not return the same result.  The intent of "
"the C standard is that ``fmod(x, y)`` be exactly (mathematically; to "
"infinite precision) equal to ``x - n*y`` for some integer *n* such that the "
"result has the same sign as *x* and magnitude less than ``abs(y)``.  "
"Python's ``x % y`` returns a result with the sign of *y* instead, and may "
"not be exactly computable for float arguments. For example, ``fmod(-1e-100, "
"1e100)`` is ``-1e-100``, but the result of Python's ``-1e-100 % 1e100`` is "
"``1e100-1e-100``, which cannot be represented exactly as a float, and rounds"
