"One of the joys of turtle graphics is the immediate, visual feedback that's "

msgstr ""

#: ../../library/turtle.rst:186

"The turtle module makes this possible by exposing all its basic "

":ref:`turtle graphics tutorial <turtle-tutorial>` covers this approach."
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/turtle.rst:190
msgid ""
"It's worth noting that many of the turtle commands also have even more terse"

#: ../../library/turtle.rst:196
msgid ""
"You'll need to have the :mod:`Tk interface package <tkinter>` installed on "

"graphics with a learner."

"Using ``from turtle import *`` is convenient - but be warned that it imports"
" a rather large collection of objects, and if you're doing anything but "

"an issue if you're using turtle graphics in a script where other modules "
"might be imported)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/turtle.rst:211

"The solution is to use ``import turtle`` - ``fd()`` becomes ``turtle.fd()``,"

"Other than for very basic introductory purposes, or for trying things out as"

"multiple turtles on screen at once."
