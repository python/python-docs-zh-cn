"This uses the Internet TCP protocol, which provides for continuous streams "
"of data between the client and server. If *bind_and_activate* is true, the "
"constructor automatically attempts to invoke :meth:`~BaseServer.server_bind`"
" and :meth:`~BaseServer.server_activate`.  The other parameters are passed "
"to the :class:`BaseServer` base class."
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/socketserver.rst:28

"This uses datagrams, which are discrete packets of information that may "
"arrive out of order or be lost while in transit.  The parameters are the "
"same as for :class:`TCPServer`."

"These more infrequently used classes are similar to the TCP and UDP classes,"

"These four classes process requests :dfn:`synchronously`; each request must "
"be completed before the next request can be started.  This isn't suitable if"
" each request takes a long time to complete, because it requires a lot of "
"computation, or because it returns a lot of data which the client is slow to"
" process.  The solution is to create a separate process or thread to handle "
"each request; the :class:`ForkingMixIn` and :class:`ThreadingMixIn` mix-in "
"classes can be used to support asynchronous behaviour."
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/socketserver.rst:50

"Creating a server requires several steps.  First, you must create a request "
"handler class by subclassing the :class:`BaseRequestHandler` class and "
"overriding its :meth:`~BaseRequestHandler.handle` method; this method will "
"process incoming requests.  Second, you must instantiate one of the server "
"classes, passing it the server's address and the request handler class. It "
"is recommended to use the server in a :keyword:`with` statement. Then call "
"the :meth:`~BaseServer.handle_request` or :meth:`~BaseServer.serve_forever` "
"method of the server object to process one or many requests.  Finally, call "
":meth:`~BaseServer.server_close` to close the socket (unless you used a "
":keyword:`!with` statement)."

#: ../../library/socketserver.rst:62
msgid ""
"When inheriting from :class:`ThreadingMixIn` for threaded connection "
"behavior, you should explicitly declare how you want your threads to behave "
"on an abrupt shutdown.  The :class:`ThreadingMixIn` class defines an "
"attribute *daemon_threads*, which indicates whether or not the server should"
" wait for thread termination.  You should set the flag explicitly if you "
"would like threads to behave autonomously; the default is :const:`False`, "
"meaning that Python will not exit until all threads created by "
":class:`ThreadingMixIn` have exited."

"To implement a service, you must derive a class from "

"Of course, you still have to use your head!  For instance, it makes no sense"
" to use a forking server if the service contains state in memory that can be"
" modified by different requests, since the modifications in the child "
"process would never reach the initial state kept in the parent process and "
"passed to each child.  In this case, you can use a threading server, but you"

"On the other hand, if you are building an HTTP server where all data is "

"all the data it has requested.  Here a threading or forking server is "

"In some cases, it may be appropriate to process part of a request "

"doing an explicit fork in the request handler class "
":meth:`~BaseRequestHandler.handle` method."

msgid ""
"Another approach to handling multiple simultaneous requests in an "
"environment that supports neither threads nor :func:`~os.fork` (or where "
"these are too expensive or inappropriate for the service) is to maintain an "
"explicit table of partially finished requests and to use :mod:`selectors` to"
" decide which request to work on next (or whether to handle a new incoming "
"request).  This is particularly important for stream services where each "
"client can potentially be connected for a long time (if threads or "
"subprocesses cannot be used).  See :mod:`asyncore` for another way to manage"
