"The :mod:`readline` module defines a number of functions to facilitate "
"completion and reading/writing of history files from the Python interpreter."
" This module can be used directly, or via the :mod:`rlcompleter` module, "
"which supports completion of Python identifiers at the interactive prompt.  "
"Settings made using  this module affect the behaviour of both the "
"interpreter's interactive prompt  and the prompts offered by the built-in "
":func:`input` function."

"Readline keybindings may be configured via an initialization file, typically"
