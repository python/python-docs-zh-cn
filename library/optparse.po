":mod:`optparse` is a more convenient, flexible, and powerful library for "
"parsing command-line options than the old :mod:`getopt` module.  "
":mod:`optparse` uses a more declarative style of command-line parsing: you "
"create an instance of :class:`OptionParser`, populate it with options, and "
"parse the command line. :mod:`optparse` allows users to specify options in "
"the conventional GNU/POSIX syntax, and additionally generates usage and help"
