msgid ""
":mod:`optparse` is a more convenient, flexible, and powerful library for "
"parsing command-line options than the old :mod:`getopt` module.  "
":mod:`optparse` uses a more declarative style of command-line parsing: you "
"create an instance of :class:`OptionParser`, populate it with options, and "
"parse the command line. :mod:`optparse` allows users to specify options in "
"the conventional GNU/POSIX syntax, and additionally generates usage and help"
" messages for you."

"command-line values.  When :meth:`parse_args` returns from parsing this "
"command line, ``options.filename`` will be ``\"outfile\"`` and "
"``options.verbose`` will be ``False``.  :mod:`optparse` supports both long "
"and short options, allows short options to be merged together, and allows "
"options to be associated with their arguments in a variety of ways.  Thus, "
"the following command lines are all equivalent to the above example::"
