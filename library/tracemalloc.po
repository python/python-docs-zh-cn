"Format the traceback as a list of lines. Use the :mod:`linecache` module to "
"retrieve lines from the source code. If *limit* is set, format the *limit* "
"most recent frames if *limit* is positive. Otherwise, format the "
"``abs(limit)`` oldest frames. If *most_recent_first* is ``True``, the order "
"of the formatted frames is reversed, returning the most recent frame first "
"instead of last."
