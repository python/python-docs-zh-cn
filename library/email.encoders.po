"This module is part of the legacy (``Compat32``) email API.  In the new API "

"When creating :class:`~email.message.Message` objects from scratch, you "
"often need to encode the payloads for transport through compliant mail "
"servers. This is especially true for :mimetype:`image/\\*` and "
":mimetype:`text/\\*` type messages containing binary data."

"The :mod:`email` package provides some convenient encodings in its "
":mod:`encoders` module.  These encoders are actually used by the "
":class:`~email.mime.audio.MIMEAudio` and "
":class:`~email.mime.image.MIMEImage` class constructors to provide default "
"encodings.  All encoder functions take exactly one argument, the message "
"object to encode.  They usually extract the payload, encode it, and reset "
"the payload to this newly encoded value.  They should also set the "
":mailheader:`Content-Transfer-Encoding` header as appropriate."

"Encodes the payload into quoted-printable form and sets the :mailheader"

"good encoding to use when most of your payload is normal printable data, but"

"Encodes the payload into base64 form and sets the :mailheader:`Content-"
"Transfer-Encoding` header to ``base64``.  This is a good encoding to use "
"when most of your payload is unprintable data since it is a more compact "
"form than quoted-printable.  The drawback of base64 encoding is that it "
"renders the text non-human readable."
