"Putting as few statements as possible in the block below ``if __name___ == "

msgid ""
"Note that if the module didn't encapsulate code inside the ``main`` function"
" but instead put it directly within the ``if __name__ == '__main__'`` block,"
" the ``phrase`` variable would be global to the entire module.  This is "
"error-prone as other functions within the module could be unintentionally "
"using the global variable instead of a local name.  A ``main`` function "
"solves this problem."
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/__main__.rst:158

"Using a ``main`` function has the added benefit of the ``echo`` function "
"itself being isolated and importable elsewhere. When ``echo.py`` is "

"``main`` functions are often used to create command-line tools by specifying"
" them as entry points for console scripts.  When this is done, `pip "
"<https://pip.pypa.io/>`_ inserts the function call into a template script, "
"where the return value of ``main`` is passed into :func:`sys.exit`. For "
"example::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/__main__.rst:175
msgid ""
"Since the call to ``main`` is wrapped in :func:`sys.exit`, the expectation "
"is that your function will return some value acceptable as an input to "
":func:`sys.exit`; typically, an integer or ``None`` (which is implicitly "
"returned if your function does not have a return statement)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/__main__.rst:180

"By proactively following this convention ourselves, our module will have the"

"if we later package it as a console script entry-point in a pip-installable "
"package."
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/__main__.rst:185
msgid ""
"In particular, be careful about returning strings from your ``main`` "
"function. :func:`sys.exit` will interpret a string argument as a failure "
"message, so your program will have an exit code of ``1``, indicating "
"failure, and the string will be written to :data:`sys.stderr`.  The "
"``echo.py`` example from earlier exemplifies using the ``sys.exit(main())`` "

msgstr ""

#: ../../library/__main__.rst:339
msgid ""
"Python inserts an empty ``__main__`` module in :attr:`sys.modules` at "
"interpreter startup, and populates it by running top-level code. In our "
"example this is the ``start`` module which runs line by line and imports "
"``namely``. In turn, ``namely`` imports ``__main__`` (which is really "
"``start``). That's an import cycle! Fortunately, since the partially "
"populated ``__main__`` module is present in :attr:`sys.modules`, Python "
"passes that to ``namely``. See :ref:`Special considerations for __main__ "
