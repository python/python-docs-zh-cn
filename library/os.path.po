"This module implements some useful functions on pathnames. To read or write "
"files see :func:`open`, and for accessing the filesystem see the :mod:`os` "
"module. The path parameters can be passed as either strings, or bytes. "
"Applications are encouraged to represent file names as (Unicode) character "
"strings. Unfortunately, some file names may not be representable as strings "
"on Unix, so applications that need to support arbitrary file names on Unix "
"should use bytes objects to represent path names. Vice versa, using bytes "
"objects cannot represent all file names on Windows (in the standard ``mbcs``"
" encoding), hence Windows applications should use string objects to access "
"all files."
