msgid ":mod:`ensurepip` --- Bootstrapping the ``pip`` installer"
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/ensurepip.rst:12
msgid ""
"The :mod:`ensurepip` package provides support for bootstrapping the ``pip`` "
"installer into an existing Python installation or virtual environment. This "
"bootstrapping approach reflects the fact that ``pip`` is an independent "
"project with its own release cycle, and the latest available stable version "
"is bundled with maintenance and feature releases of the CPython reference "
"interpreter."
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/ensurepip.rst:19
msgid ""
"In most cases, end users of Python shouldn't need to invoke this module "
"directly (as ``pip`` should be bootstrapped by default), but it may be "
"needed if installing ``pip`` was skipped when installing Python (or when "
"creating a virtual environment) or after explicitly uninstalling ``pip``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/ensurepip.rst:27
msgid ""
"This module *does not* access the internet. All of the components needed to "
"bootstrap ``pip`` are included as internal parts of the package."

"By default, ``pip`` is installed into the current virtual environment (if "

"``--root <dir>``: Installs ``pip`` relative to the given root directory "
"rather than the root of the currently active virtual environment (if any) or"
" the default root for the current Python installation."
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/ensurepip.rst:64
msgid ""
"``--user``: Installs ``pip`` into the user site packages directory rather "
"than globally for the current Python installation (this option is not "
"permitted inside an active virtual environment)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/ensurepip.rst:68
msgid ""
"By default, the scripts ``pipX`` and ``pipX.Y`` will be installed (where X.Y"
" stands for the version of Python used to invoke ``ensurepip``). The scripts"
" installed can be controlled through two additional command line options:"

#: ../../library/ensurepip.rst:73

"``--altinstall``: if an alternate installation is requested, the ``pipX`` "
"script will *not* be installed."

"*upgrade* indicates whether or not to upgrade an existing installation of an"
