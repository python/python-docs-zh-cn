"Iterating over a message object tree is fairly easy with the "
":meth:`Message.walk <email.message.Message.walk>` method.  The "
":mod:`email.iterators` module provides some useful higher level iterations "
"over message object trees."

"This iterates over all the payloads in all the subparts of *msg*, returning "
"the string payloads line-by-line.  It skips over all the subpart headers, "
"and it skips over any subpart with a payload that isn't a Python string.  "
"This is somewhat equivalent to reading the flat text representation of the "
"message from a file using :meth:`~io.TextIOBase.readline`, skipping over all"
" the intervening headers."

"Note that *subtype* is optional; if omitted, then subpart MIME type matching"
