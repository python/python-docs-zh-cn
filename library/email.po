"The :mod:`email` package is a library for managing email messages.  It is "
"specifically *not* designed to do any sending of email messages to SMTP "
"(:rfc:`2821`), NNTP, or other servers; those are functions of modules such "
"as :mod:`smtplib` and :mod:`nntplib`.  The :mod:`email` package attempts to "
"be as RFC-compliant as possible, supporting :rfc:`5233` and :rfc:`6532`, as "
"well as such MIME-related RFCs as :rfc:`2045`, :rfc:`2046`, :rfc:`2047`, "
":rfc:`2183`, and :rfc:`2231`."

"The overall structure of the email package can be divided into three major "
"components, plus a fourth component that controls the behavior of the other "
"components."
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/email.rst:27
msgid ""
"The central component of the package is an \"object model\" that represents "
"email messages.  An application interacts with the package primarily through"
" the object model interface defined in the :mod:`~email.message` sub-module."
"  The application can use this API to ask questions about an existing email,"
" to construct a new email, or to add or remove email subcomponents that "
"themselves use the same object model interface.  That is, following the "
"nature of email messages and their MIME subcomponents, the email object "
"model is a tree structure of objects that all provide the "
":class:`~email.message.EmailMessage` API."
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/email.rst:37
msgid ""
"The other two major components of the package are the :mod:`~email.parser` "
"and the :mod:`~email.generator`.  The parser takes the serialized version of"
" an email message (a stream of bytes) and converts it into a tree of "
":class:`~email.message.EmailMessage` objects.  The generator takes an "
":class:`~email.message.EmailMessage` and turns it back into a serialized "
"byte stream.  (The parser and generator also handle streams of text "
"characters, but this usage is discouraged as it is too easy to end up with "
"messages that are not valid in one way or another.)"
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/email.rst:46
msgid ""
"The control component is the :mod:`~email.policy` module.  Every "
":class:`~email.message.EmailMessage`, every :mod:`~email.generator`, and "
"every :mod:`~email.parser` has an associated :mod:`~email.policy` object "
"that controls its behavior.  Usually an application only needs to specify "
"the policy when an :class:`~email.message.EmailMessage` is created, either "
"by directly instantiating an :class:`~email.message.EmailMessage`  to create"
" a new email, or by parsing an input stream using a :mod:`~email.parser`.  "
"But the policy can be changed when the message is serialized using a "
":mod:`~email.generator`. This allows, for example, a generic email message "
"to be parsed from disk, but to serialize it using standard SMTP settings "
"when sending it to an email server."

"The email package does its best to hide the details of the various governing"
" RFCs from the application.  Conceptually the application should be able to "
"treat the email message as a structured tree of unicode text and binary "
"attachments, without having to worry about how these are represented when "
"serialized.  In practice, however, it is often necessary to be aware of at "
"least some of the rules governing MIME messages and their structure, "
"specifically the names and nature of the MIME \"content types\" and how they"
" identify multipart documents.  For the most part this knowledge should only"
" be required for more complex applications, and even then it should only be "
"the high level structure in question, and not the details of how those "
"structures are represented.  Since MIME content types are used widely in "
"modern internet software (not just email), this will be a familiar concept "
"to many programmers."

"The following sections describe the functionality of the :mod:`email` "
"package. We start with the :mod:`~email.message` object model, which is the "
"primary interface an application will use, and follow that with the "
":mod:`~email.parser` and :mod:`~email.generator` components.  Then we cover "
"the :mod:`~email.policy` controls, which completes the treatment of the main"
" components of the library."
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/email.rst:78
msgid ""
"The next three sections cover the exceptions the package may raise and the "
"defects (non-compliance with the RFCs) that the :mod:`~email.parser` may "
"detect.  Then we cover the :mod:`~email.headerregistry` and the "
":mod:`~email.contentmanager` sub-components, which provide tools for doing "
"more detailed manipulation of headers and payloads, respectively.  Both of "
"these components contain features relevant to consuming and producing non-"
"trivial messages, but also document their extensibility APIs, which will be "
"of interest to advanced applications."

"Following those is a set of examples of using the fundamental parts of the "
"APIs covered in the preceding sections."

"The foregoing represent the modern (unicode friendly) API of the email "
"package. The remaining sections, starting with the "
":class:`~email.message.Message` class, cover the legacy "
":data:`~email.policy.compat32` API that deals much more directly with the "
"details of how email messages are represented.  The "
":data:`~email.policy.compat32` API does *not* hide the details of the RFCs "
"from the application, but for applications that need to operate at that "
"level, they can be useful tools.  This documentation is also relevant for "
"applications that are still using the :mod:`~email.policy.compat32` API for "
"backward compatibility reasons."
