"An :class:`SMTP` instance encapsulates an SMTP connection.  It has methods "
"that support a full repertoire of SMTP and ESMTP operations. If the optional"
" host and port parameters are given, the SMTP :meth:`connect` method is "
"called with those parameters during initialization.  If specified, "
"*local_hostname* is used as the FQDN of the local host in the HELO/EHLO "
"command.  Otherwise, the local hostname is found using "
":func:`socket.getfqdn`.  If the :meth:`connect` call returns anything other "
"than a success code, an :exc:`SMTPConnectError` is raised. The optional "
"*timeout* parameter specifies a timeout in seconds for blocking operations "
"like the connection attempt (if not specified, the global default timeout "
"setting will be used).  If the timeout expires, :exc:`socket.timeout` is "
"raised.  The optional source_address parameter allows binding to some "
"specific source address in a machine with multiple network interfaces, "
"and/or to some specific source TCP port. It takes a 2-tuple (host, port), "
"for the socket to bind to as its source address before connecting. If "
"omitted (or if host or port are ``''`` and/or 0 respectively) the OS default"
