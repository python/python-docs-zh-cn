"The :mod:`codeop` module provides utilities upon which the Python read-eval-"
"print loop can be emulated, as is done in the :mod:`code` module.  As a "
"result, you probably don't want to use the module directly; if you want to "
"include such a loop in your program you probably want to use the :mod:`code`"
" module instead."

":mod:`codeop` 模块提供了可以模拟Python读取-执行-打印循环的实用程序，就像在 :mod:`code` "
"模块中一样。因此，您可能不希望直接使用该模块；如果你想在程序中包含这样一个循环，你可能需要使用 :mod:`code` 模块。"

"It is possible (but not likely) that the parser stops parsing with a "
