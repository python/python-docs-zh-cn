"The :mod:`codeop` module provides utilities upon which the Python read-eval-"
"print loop can be emulated, as is done in the :mod:`code` module.  As a "
"result, you probably don't want to use the module directly; if you want to "
"include such a loop in your program you probably want to use the :mod:`code`"
" module instead."

"Being able to tell if a line of input completes a Python  statement: in "
"short, telling whether to print '``>>>``' or '``...``' next."

"Remembering which future statements the user has entered, so  subsequent "
"input can be compiled with these in effect."

"The :mod:`codeop` module provides a way of doing each of these things, and a"
" way of doing them both."

"Tries to compile *source*, which should be a string of Python code and "
"return a code object if *source* is valid Python code. In that case, the "
"filename attribute of the code object will be *filename*, which defaults to "
"``'<input>'``. Returns ``None`` if *source* is *not* valid Python code, but "
"is a prefix of valid Python code."

"If there is a problem with *source*, an exception will be raised. "
":exc:`SyntaxError` is raised if there is invalid Python syntax, and "

"The *symbol* argument determines whether *source* is compiled as a statement"
" (``'single'``, the default), as a sequence of statements (``'exec'``) or as"
" an :term:`expression` (``'eval'``).  Any other value will cause "
":exc:`ValueError` to  be raised."

"It is possible (but not likely) that the parser stops parsing with a "
"successful outcome before reaching the end of the source; in this case, "
"trailing symbols may be ignored instead of causing an error.  For example, a"
" backslash followed by two newlines may be followed by arbitrary garbage. "
"This will be fixed once the API for the parser is better."
