"While :ref:`reference-index` describes the exact syntax and semantics of the"
" Python language, this library reference manual describes the standard "
"library that is distributed with Python. It also describes some of the "
"optional components that are commonly included in Python distributions."
msgstr ""
":ref:`reference-index` 描述了 Python 语言的具体语法和语义，这份库参考则介绍了与 Python "
"一同发行的标准库。它还描述了通常包含在 Python 发行版中的一些可选组件。"

"Python's standard library is very extensive, offering a wide range of "
"facilities as indicated by the long table of contents listed below. The "
"library contains built-in modules (written in C) that provide access to "
"system functionality such as file I/O that would otherwise be inaccessible "
"to Python programmers, as well as modules written in Python that provide "
"standardized solutions for many problems that occur in everyday programming."
" Some of these modules are explicitly designed to encourage and enhance the "
"portability of Python programs by abstracting away platform-specifics into "
"platform-neutral APIs."
msgstr ""
"Python 标准库非常庞大，所提供的组件涉及范围十分广泛，正如以下内容目录所显示的。这个库包含了多个内置模块 (以 C 编写)，Python "
"程序员必须依靠它们来实现系统级功能，例如文件 I/O，此外还有大量以 Python "
"编写的模块，提供了日常编程中许多问题的标准解决方案。其中有些模块经过专门设计，通过将特定平台功能抽象化为平台中立的 API 来鼓励和加强 Python "
"程序的可移植性。"

"The Python installers for the Windows platform usually include the entire "
"standard library and often also include many additional components. For "
"Unix-like operating systems Python is normally provided as a collection of "
"packages, so it may be necessary to use the packaging tools provided with "
"the operating system to obtain some or all of the optional components."
msgstr ""
"Windows 版本的 Python 安装程序通常包含整个标准库，往往还包含许多额外组件。对于类 Unix 操作系统，Python "
"通常会分成一系列的软件包，因此可能需要使用操作系统所提供的包管理工具来获取部分或全部可选组件。"

"In addition to the standard library, there is a growing collection of "
"several thousand components (from individual programs and modules to "
"packages and entire application development frameworks), available from the "
"`Python Package Index <https://pypi.org>`_."
msgstr ""
"在这个标准库以外还存在成千上万并且不断增加的其他组件 (从单独的程序、模块、软件包直到完整的应用开发框架)，访问 `Python 包索引 "
"<https://pypi.org>`_ 即可获取这些第三方包。"
