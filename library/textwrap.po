"The :mod:`textwrap` module provides some convenience functions, as well as "
":class:`TextWrapper`, the class that does all the work. If you're just "
"wrapping or filling one or two text strings, the convenience functions "
"should be good enough; otherwise, you should use an instance of "
":class:`TextWrapper` for efficiency."

":func:`wrap`, :func:`fill` and :func:`shorten` work by creating a "

"your own :class:`TextWrapper` object."

"(default: ``False``) If true, :class:`TextWrapper` attempts to detect "
"sentence endings and ensure that sentences are always separated by exactly "
"two spaces.  This is generally desired for text in a monospaced font. "
"However, the sentence detection algorithm is imperfect: it assumes that a "
"sentence ending consists of a lowercase letter followed by one of ``'.'``, "
"``'!'``, or ``'?'``, possibly followed by one of ``'\"'`` or ``\"'\"``, "
"followed by a space.  One problem with this is algorithm is that it is "
"unable to detect the difference between \"Dr.\" in ::"

" after a period to separate sentences on the same line, it is specific to "
"English-language texts."

"(default: ``True``) If true, then words longer than :attr:`width` will be "
"broken in order to ensure that no lines are longer than :attr:`width`.  If "
"it is false, long words will not be broken, and some lines may be longer "
"than :attr:`width`.  (Long words will be put on a line by themselves, in "
"order to minimize the amount by which :attr:`width` is exceeded.)"

"(default: ``True``) If true, wrapping will occur preferably on whitespaces "
"and right after hyphens in compound words, as it is customary in English. If"
" false, only whitespaces will be considered as potentially good places for "
"line breaks, but you need to set :attr:`break_long_words` to false if you "
