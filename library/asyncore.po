"There are only two ways to have a program on a single processor do  \"more "
"than one thing at a time.\" Multi-threaded programming is the  simplest and "
"most popular way to do it, but there is another very different technique, "
"that lets you have nearly all the advantages of  multi-threading, without "
"actually using multiple threads.  It's really  only practical if your "
"program is largely I/O bound.  If your program is processor bound, then pre-"
"emptive scheduled threads are probably what you really need.  Network "
"servers are rarely processor bound, however."

"If your operating system supports the :c:func:`select` system call in its "

"complex, especially at first, it is in many ways easier to understand and "
"control than multi-threaded programming.  The :mod:`asyncore` module solves "
"many of the difficult problems for you, making the task of building "
