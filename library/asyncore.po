"There are only two ways to have a program on a single processor do  \"more "
"than one thing at a time.\" Multi-threaded programming is the  simplest and "
"most popular way to do it, but there is another very different technique, "
"that lets you have nearly all the advantages of  multi-threading, without "
"actually using multiple threads.  It's really  only practical if your "
"program is largely I/O bound.  If your program is processor bound, then pre-"
"emptive scheduled threads are probably what you really need.  Network "
"servers are rarely processor bound, however."

"只有两种方法让单个处理器上的程序“同一时间完成不止一件事”。 "
"多线程编程是最简单和最流行的方法，但是还有另一种非常不同的技术，它可以让你拥有多线程的几乎所有优点，而无需实际使用多线程。 它仅仅在你的程序主要受 "

"If your operating system supports the :c:func:`select` system call in its "
"I/O library (and nearly all do), then you can use it to juggle multiple "
"communication channels at once; doing other work while your I/O is taking "
"place in the \"background.\"  Although this strategy can seem strange and "
"complex, especially at first, it is in many ways easier to understand and "
"control than multi-threaded programming.  The :mod:`asyncore` module solves "
"many of the difficult problems for you, making the task of building "
"sophisticated high-performance network servers and clients a snap.  For "
"\"conversational\" applications and protocols the companion :mod:`asynchat` "

"如果你的操作系统在其 I/O 库中支持 :c:func:`select` 系统调用（几乎所有操作系统），那么你可以使用它来同时处理多个通信通道；在 "
