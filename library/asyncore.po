"There are only two ways to have a program on a single processor do  \"more "
"than one thing at a time.\" Multi-threaded programming is the  simplest and "
"most popular way to do it, but there is another very different technique, "
"that lets you have nearly all the advantages of  multi-threading, without "
"actually using multiple threads.  It's really  only practical if your "
"program is largely I/O bound.  If your program is processor bound, then pre-"
"emptive scheduled threads are probably what you really need.  Network "
"servers are rarely processor bound, however."

"If your operating system supports the :c:func:`select` system call in its "
"I/O library (and nearly all do), then you can use it to juggle multiple "
"communication channels at once; doing other work while your I/O is taking "
"place in the \"background.\"  Although this strategy can seem strange and "
"complex, especially at first, it is in many ways easier to understand and "
"control than multi-threaded programming.  The :mod:`asyncore` module solves "
"many of the difficult problems for you, making the task of building "
"sophisticated high-performance network servers and clients a snap.  For "
"\"conversational\" applications and protocols the companion :mod:`asynchat` "

"The basic idea behind both modules is to create one or more network "
"*channels*, instances of class :class:`asyncore.dispatcher` and "
":class:`asynchat.async_chat`.  Creating the channels adds them to a global "

"parameter for the appropriate :func:`~select.select` or :func:`~select.poll`"
" call, measured in seconds; the default is 30 seconds.  The *use_poll* "

"The *map* parameter is a dictionary whose items are the channels to watch. "

"The :class:`dispatcher` class is a thin wrapper around a low-level socket "

"The firing of low-level events at certain times or in certain connection "
"states tells the asynchronous loop that certain higher-level events have "
"taken place.  For example, if we have asked for a socket to connect to "
"another host, we know that the connection has been made when the socket "
"becomes writable for the first time (at this point you know that you may "
"write to it with the expectation of success).  The implied higher-level "
