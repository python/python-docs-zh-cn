"This module provides support for reading and writing AIFF and AIFF-C files. "
"AIFF is Audio Interchange File Format, a format for storing digital audio "
"samples in a file.  AIFF-C is a newer version of the format that includes "
"the ability to compress the audio data."

"Audio files have a number of parameters that describe the audio data. The "
"sampling rate or frame rate is the number of times per second the sound is "
"sampled.  The number of channels indicate if the audio is mono, stereo, or "
"quadro.  Each frame consists of one sample per channel.  The sample size is "
"the size in bytes of each sample.  Thus a frame consists of ``nchannels * "
"samplesize`` bytes, and a second's worth of audio consists of ``nchannels * "
"samplesize * framerate`` bytes."

"For example, CD quality audio has a sample size of two bytes (16 bits), uses"
" two channels (stereo) and has a frame rate of 44,100 frames/second.  This "

"2\\*2\\*44100 bytes (176,400 bytes)."

"must be opened for reading, or ``'w'``  or ``'wb'`` when the file must be "
"opened for writing. If omitted, ``file.mode`` is used if it exists, "
"otherwise ``'rb'`` is used.  When used for writing, the file object should "
