"The :class:`scheduler` class defines a generic interface to scheduling "
"events. It needs two functions to actually deal with the \"outside world\" "
"--- *timefunc* should be callable without arguments, and return  a number "
"(the \"time\", in any units whatsoever).  The *delayfunc* function should be"
" callable with one argument, compatible with the output of *timefunc*, and "
"should delay that many time units. *delayfunc* will also be called with the "
"argument ``0`` after each event is run to allow other threads an opportunity"
" to run in multi-threaded applications."

":class:`scheduler` instances have the following methods and attributes:"

msgid ""
"Schedule a new event. The *time* argument should be a numeric type "
"compatible with the return value of the *timefunc* function passed  to the "
"constructor. Events scheduled for the same *time* will be executed in the "
"order of their *priority*. A lower number represents a higher priority."
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/sched.rst:73

"Executing the event means executing ``action(*argument, **kwargs)``. "
"*argument* is a sequence holding the positional arguments for *action*. "
"*kwargs* is a dictionary holding the keyword arguments for *action*."

"Either *action* or *delayfunc* can raise an exception.  In either case, the "
"scheduler will maintain a consistent state and propagate the exception.  If "
"an exception is raised by *action*, the event will not be attempted in "
"future calls to :meth:`run`."

#: ../../library/sched.rst:125
msgid ""
"If a sequence of events takes longer to run than the time available before "
"the next event, the scheduler will simply fall behind.  No events will be "
