"A weak reference to an object is not enough to keep the object alive: when "

"For example, if you have a number of large binary image objects, you may "
"wish to associate a name with each.  If you used a Python dictionary to map "

":class:`WeakKeyDictionary` and :class:`WeakValueDictionary` classes supplied"
" by the :mod:`weakref` module are an alternative, using weak references to "
"construct mappings that don't keep objects alive solely because they appear "
"in the mapping objects.  If, for example, an image object is a value in a "
":class:`WeakValueDictionary`, then when the last remaining references to "
"that image object are the weak references held by weak mappings, garbage "
