"The :mod:`weakref` module allows the Python programmer to create :dfn:`weak "
"references` to objects."
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/weakref.rst:24
msgid ""
"In the following, the term :dfn:`referent` means the object which is "
"referred to by a weak reference."

#: ../../library/weakref.rst:27
msgid ""
"A weak reference to an object is not enough to keep the object alive: when "
"the only remaining references to a referent are weak references, "
":term:`garbage collection` is free to destroy the referent and reuse its "
"memory for something else.  However, until the object is actually destroyed "
"the weak reference may return the object even if there are no strong "
"references to it."
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/weakref.rst:33
msgid ""
"A primary use for weak references is to implement caches or mappings holding"
" large objects, where it's desired that a large object not be kept alive "
"solely because it appears in a cache or mapping."
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/weakref.rst:37
msgid ""
"For example, if you have a number of large binary image objects, you may "
"wish to associate a name with each.  If you used a Python dictionary to map "
"names to images, or images to names, the image objects would remain alive "
"just because they appeared as values or keys in the dictionaries.  The "
":class:`WeakKeyDictionary` and :class:`WeakValueDictionary` classes supplied"
" by the :mod:`weakref` module are an alternative, using weak references to "
"construct mappings that don't keep objects alive solely because they appear "
"in the mapping objects.  If, for example, an image object is a value in a "
":class:`WeakValueDictionary`, then when the last remaining references to "
"that image object are the weak references held by weak mappings, garbage "
"collection can reclaim the object, and its corresponding entries in weak "
"mappings are simply deleted."
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/weakref.rst:50
msgid ""
":class:`WeakKeyDictionary` and :class:`WeakValueDictionary` use weak "
"references in their implementation, setting up callback functions on the "
"weak references that notify the weak dictionaries when a key or value has "
"been reclaimed by garbage collection.  :class:`WeakSet` implements the "
":class:`set` interface, but keeps weak references to its elements, just like"
" a :class:`WeakKeyDictionary` does."

#: ../../library/weakref.rst:57
msgid ""
":class:`finalize` provides a straight forward way to register a cleanup "
"function to be called when an object is garbage collected. This is simpler "
"to use than setting up a callback function on a raw weak reference, since "
"the module automatically ensures that the finalizer remains alive until the "
"object is collected."
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/weakref.rst:63
msgid ""
"Most programs should find that using one of these weak container types or "
