msgstr "\"Python 库\"中包含了几种不同的组件。"

"It contains data types that would normally be considered part of the "
"\"core\" of a language, such as numbers and lists.  For these types, the "
"Python language core defines the form of literals and places some "
"constraints on their semantics, but does not fully define the semantics.  "
"(On the other hand, the language core does define syntactic properties like "
"the spelling and priorities of operators.)"
msgstr ""
"它包含通常被视为语言“核心”中的一部分的数据类型，例如数字和列表。对于这些类型，Python语言核心定义了文字的形式，并对它们的语义设置了一些约束，但没有完全定义语义。（另一方面，语言核心确实定义了语法属性，如操作符的拼写和优先级。）"

"The library also contains built-in functions and exceptions --- objects that"
" can be used by all Python code without the need of an :keyword:`import` "
"statement. Some of these are defined by the core language, but many are not "
"essential for the core semantics and are only described here."
msgstr ""
"这个库也包含了内置函数和异常 --- 不需要 :keyword:`import` "
"语句就可以在所有Python代码中使用的对象。有一些是由语言核心定义的，但是许多对于核心语义不是必需的，并且仅在这里描述。"

"The bulk of the library, however, consists of a collection of modules. There"
" are many ways to dissect this collection.  Some modules are written in C "
"and built in to the Python interpreter; others are written in Python and "
"imported in source form.  Some modules provide interfaces that are highly "
"specific to Python, like printing a stack trace; some provide interfaces "
"that are specific to particular operating systems, such as access to "
"specific hardware; others provide interfaces that are specific to a "
"particular application domain, like the World Wide Web. Some modules are "
"available in all versions and ports of Python; others are only available "
"when the underlying system supports or requires them; yet others are "
"available only when a particular configuration option was chosen at the time"
" when Python was compiled and installed."
msgstr ""
"不过这个库主要是由一系列的模块组成。这些模块集可以不同方式分类。有些模块是用 C 编写并内置于 Python 解释器中；另一些模块则是用 Python "
"编写并以源码形式导入。有些模块提供专用于 Python "
"的接口，例如打印栈追踪信息；有些模块提供专用于特定操作系统的接口，例如操作特定的硬件；另一些模块则提供针对特定应用领域的接口，例如万维网。有些模块在所有更新和移植版本的"
" Python 中可用；另一些模块仅在底层系统支持或要求时可用；还有些模块则仅当编译和安装 Python 时选择了特定配置选项时才可用。"

"This manual is organized \"from the inside out:\" it first describes the "
"built-in functions, data types and exceptions, and finally the modules, "
"grouped in chapters of related modules."
msgstr "本手册以 \"从内到外\" 的顺序组织：首先描述内置函数、数据类型和异常，最后是根据相关性进行分组的各种模块。"

"This means that if you start reading this manual from the start, and skip to"
" the next chapter when you get bored, you will get a reasonable overview of "
"the available modules and application areas that are supported by the Python"
" library.  Of course, you don't *have* to read it like a novel --- you can "
"also browse the table of contents (in front of the manual), or look for a "
"specific function, module or term in the index (in the back).  And finally, "
"if you enjoy learning about random subjects, you choose a random page number"
" (see module :mod:`random`) and read a section or two.  Regardless of the "
"order in which you read the sections of this manual, it helps to start with "
"chapter :ref:`built-in-funcs`, as the remainder of the manual assumes "
"familiarity with this material."
msgstr ""
"这意味着如果你从头开始阅读本手册，并在感到厌烦时跳到下一章，你仍能对 Python 库的可用模块和所支持的应用领域有个大致了解。当然，你并非 *必须* "
"如同读小说一样从头读到尾 --- 你也可以先浏览内容目录 (在手册开头)，或在索引 (在手册末尾) "
"中查找某个特定函数、模块或条目。最后，如果你喜欢随意学习某个主题，你可以选择一个随机页码 (参见 :mod:`random` 模块) "
"并读上一两小节。无论你想以怎样的顺序阅读本手册，还是建议先从 :ref:`built-in-funcs` "
"这一章开始，因为本手册的其余内容都需要你熟悉其中的基本概念。"

"An \"Availability: Unix\" note means that this function is commonly found on"
" Unix systems.  It does not make any claims about its existence on a "
"specific operating system."
msgstr "如果出现“适用：Unix”注释，意味着相应函数通常存在于 Unix 系统中。 但这并不保证其存在于某个特定的操作系统中。"

msgid ""
"If not separately noted, all functions that claim \"Availability: Unix\" are"
" supported on macOS, which builds on a Unix core."
msgstr "如果没有单独说明，所有注明 \"可用性: Unix\" 的函数都在 macOS 上受到支持，因为此系统是基于 Unix 内核的。"
