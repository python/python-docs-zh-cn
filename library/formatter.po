"Formatter objects transform an abstract flow of formatting events into "
"specific output events on writer objects.  Formatters manage several stack "
"structures to allow various properties of a writer object to be changed and "
"restored; writers need not be able to handle relative changes nor any sort "
"of \"change back\" operation.  Specific writer properties which may be "
"controlled via formatter objects are horizontal alignment, font, and left "
"margin indentations.  A mechanism is provided which supports providing "
"arbitrary, non-exclusive style settings to a writer as well.  Additional "
"interfaces facilitate formatting events which are not reversible, such as "
"paragraph separation."
