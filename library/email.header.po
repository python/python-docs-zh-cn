"This module is part of the legacy (``Compat32``) email API.  In the current "
"API encoding and decoding of headers is handled transparently by the "
"dictionary-like API of the :class:`~email.message.EmailMessage` class.  In "
"addition to uses in legacy code, this module can be useful in applications "
"that need to completely control the character sets used when encoding "
"headers."

":rfc:`2822` is the base standard that describes the format of email "
"messages. It derives from the older :rfc:`822` standard which came into "
"widespread use at a time when most email was composed of ASCII characters "
"only.  :rfc:`2822` is a specification written assuming email contains only "
"7-bit ASCII characters."

msgid ""
"Of course, as email has been deployed worldwide, it has become "
"internationalized, such that language specific character sets can now be "
"used in email messages.  The base standard still requires email messages to "
"be transferred using only 7-bit ASCII characters, so a slew of RFCs have "
"been written describing how to encode email containing non-ASCII characters "
"into :rfc:`2822`\\ -compliant format. These RFCs include :rfc:`2045`, "
":rfc:`2046`, :rfc:`2047`, and :rfc:`2231`. The :mod:`email` package supports"
" these standards in its :mod:`email.header` and :mod:`email.charset` "
"modules."

"If you want to include non-ASCII characters in your email headers, say in "
"the :mailheader:`Subject` or :mailheader:`To` fields, you should use the "
":class:`Header` class and assign the field in the "
":class:`~email.message.Message` object to an instance of :class:`Header` "
"instead of using a string for the header value.  Import the :class:`Header` "
"class from the :mod:`email.header` module. For example::"

"Notice here how we wanted the :mailheader:`Subject` field to contain a non-"
"ASCII character?  We did this by creating a :class:`Header` instance and "
"passing in the character set that the byte string was encoded in.  When the "
"subsequent :class:`~email.message.Message` instance was flattened, the "
":mailheader:`Subject` field was properly :rfc:`2047` encoded.  MIME-aware "
"mail readers would show this header using the embedded ISO-8859-1 character."
