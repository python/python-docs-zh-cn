"Return a new hmac object.  *key* is a bytes or bytearray object giving the "

"*digestmod* is the digest name, digest constructor or module for the HMAC "

"its argument position, it is required."

"Parameter *key* can be a bytes or bytearray object. Parameter *msg* can be "

"Return digest of *msg* for given secret *key* and *digest*. The function is "
