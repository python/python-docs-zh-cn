"Decimal numbers can be represented exactly.  In contrast, numbers like "
":const:`1.1` and :const:`2.2` do not have exact representations in binary "

"The exactness carries over into arithmetic.  In decimal floating point, "
"``0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 - 0.3`` is exactly equal to zero.  In binary floating "
"point, the result is :const:`5.5511151231257827e-017`.  While near to zero, "

"The decimal module incorporates a notion of significant places so that "

"For multiplication, the \"schoolbook\" approach uses all the figures in the "
