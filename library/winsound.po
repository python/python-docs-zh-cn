"machinery provided by Windows platforms.  It includes functions and several "
"constants."

"Beep the PC's speaker. The *frequency* parameter specifies frequency, in "
"hertz, of the sound, and must be in the range 37 through 32,767. The "
"*duration* parameter specifies the number of milliseconds the sound should "
"last.  If the system is not able to beep the speaker, :exc:`RuntimeError` is"
" raised."

"Call the underlying :c:func:`!PlaySound` function from the Platform API.  "
"The *sound* parameter may be a filename, a system sound alias, audio data as"
" a :term:`bytes-like object`, or ``None``.  Its interpretation depends on "
"the value of *flags*, which can be a bitwise ORed combination of the "
"constants described below. If the *sound* parameter is ``None``, any "
"currently playing waveform sound is stopped. If the system indicates an "
"error, :exc:`RuntimeError` is raised."

"``MB_ICONASTERISK``, ``MB_ICONEXCLAMATION``, ``MB_ICONHAND``, "
"``MB_ICONQUESTION``, and ``MB_OK``, all described below.  The value ``-1`` "
"produces a \"simple beep\"; this is the final fallback if a sound cannot be "
"played otherwise.  If the system indicates an error, :exc:`RuntimeError` is "
