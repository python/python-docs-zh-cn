"In Python, all exceptions must be instances of a class that derives from "
":class:`BaseException`.  In a :keyword:`try` statement with an "
":keyword:`except` clause that mentions a particular class, that clause also "
"handles any exception classes derived from that class (but not exception "
"classes from which *it* is derived).  Two exception classes that are not "
"related via subclassing are never equivalent, even if they have the same "
"name."

"The built-in exceptions listed below can be generated by the interpreter or "

"explaining the code).  The associated value is usually passed as arguments "
