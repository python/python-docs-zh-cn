"Raised under some error conditions when parsing the :rfc:`5322` headers of a"

":meth:`~email.message.EmailMessage.set_boundary` method will raise this "
"error if the content type is unknown when the method is called. "
":class:`~email.header.Header` may raise this error for certain base64 "

" to contain an embedded header (that is, there is what is supposed to be a "
"continuation line that has no leading whitespace and looks like a header)."
