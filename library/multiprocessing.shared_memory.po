"This module provides a class, :class:`SharedMemory`, for the allocation and "
"management of shared memory to be accessed by one or more processes on a "
"multicore or symmetric multiprocessor (SMP) machine.  To assist with the "
"life-cycle management of shared memory especially across distinct processes,"
" a :class:`~multiprocessing.managers.BaseManager` subclass, "
":class:`~multiprocessing.managers.SharedMemoryManager`, is also provided in "
"the :mod:`multiprocessing.managers` module."

"In this module, shared memory refers to \"System V style\" shared memory "
"blocks (though is not necessarily implemented explicitly as such) and does "
"not refer to \"distributed shared memory\".  This style of shared memory "
"permits distinct processes to potentially read and write to a common (or "
"shared) region of volatile memory.  Processes are conventionally limited to "
"only have access to their own process memory space but shared memory permits"
" the sharing of data between processes, avoiding the need to instead send "
"messages between processes containing that data.  Sharing data directly via "
"memory can provide significant performance benefits compared to sharing data"
" via disk or socket or other communications requiring the "
"serialization/deserialization and copying of data."
msgstr ""
"本模块中，共享内存是指 \"System V 类型\" 的共享内存块（虽然可能和它实现方式不完全一致）而不是 "
"“分布式共享内存”。这种类型的的共享内存允许不同进程读写一片公共（或者共享）的易失性存储区域。一般来说，进程被限制只能访问属于自己进程空间的内存，但是共享内存允许跨进程共享数据，从而避免通过进程间发送消息的形式传递数据。相比通过磁盘、套接字或者其他要求序列化、反序列化和复制数据的共享形式，直接通过内存共享数据拥有更出色性能。"
