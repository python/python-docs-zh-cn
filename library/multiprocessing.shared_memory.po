":mod:`multiprocessing.shared_memory` ---  Provides shared memory for direct "

"This module provides a class, :class:`SharedMemory`, for the allocation and "
"management of shared memory to be accessed by one or more processes on a "
"multicore or symmetric multiprocessor (SMP) machine.  To assist with the "
"life-cycle management of shared memory especially across distinct processes,"
" a :class:`~multiprocessing.managers.BaseManager` subclass, "
":class:`SharedMemoryManager`, is also provided in the "
"``multiprocessing.managers`` module."

"In this module, shared memory refers to \"System V style\" shared memory "
"blocks (though is not necessarily implemented explicitly as such) and does "
"not refer to \"distributed shared memory\".  This style of shared memory "
"permits distinct processes to potentially read and write to a common (or "
"shared) region of volatile memory.  Processes are conventionally limited to "
"only have access to their own process memory space but shared memory permits"
" the sharing of data between processes, avoiding the need to instead send "
"messages between processes containing that data.  Sharing data directly via "
"memory can provide significant performance benefits compared to sharing data"
" via disk or socket or other communications requiring the "
"serialization/deserialization and copying of data."

"Creates a new shared memory block or attaches to an existing shared memory "

"same name."

"As a resource for sharing data across processes, shared memory blocks may "
"outlive the original process that created them.  When one process no longer "
"needs access to a shared memory block that might still be needed by other "
"processes, the :meth:`close()` method should be called. When a shared memory"
" block is no longer needed by any process, the :meth:`unlink()` method "
"should be called to ensure proper cleanup."

"*size* specifies the requested number of bytes when creating a new shared "

"Closes access to the shared memory from this instance.  In order to ensure "

"Requests that the underlying shared memory block be destroyed.  In order to "
"ensure proper cleanup of resources, ``unlink()`` should be called once (and "
"only once) across all processes which have need for the shared memory block."
"  After requesting its destruction, a shared memory block may or may not be "
"immediately destroyed and this behavior may differ across platforms.  "
"Attempts to access data inside the shared memory block after ``unlink()`` "
"has been called may result in memory access errors.  Note: the last process "
"relinquishing its hold on a shared memory block may call ``unlink()`` and "
":meth:`close()` in either order."
