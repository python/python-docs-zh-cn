"The :mod:`pyclbr` module provides limited information about the functions, "
"classes, and methods defined in a Python-coded module.  The information is "
"sufficient to implement a module browser.  The information is extracted from"
" the Python source code rather than by importing the module, so this module "
"is safe to use with untrusted code. This restriction makes it impossible to "
"use this module with modules not implemented in Python, including all "
"standard and optional extension modules."

"Return a dictionary mapping module-level class names to class descriptors.  "
"If possible, descriptors for imported base classes are included.  Parameter "
"*module* is a string with the name of the module to read; it may be the name"
" of a module within a package.  If given, *path* is a sequence of directory "
"paths prepended to ``sys.path``, which is used to locate the module source "
"code."

"Return a dictionary-based tree containing a function or class descriptors "

"children dictionary of their parent.  As with readmodule, *module* names the"
" module to be read and *path* is prepended to sys.path.  If the module being"
" read is a package, the returned dictionary has a key ``'__path__'`` whose "
"value is a list containing the package search path."
