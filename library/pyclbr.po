"The :mod:`pyclbr` module can be used to determine some limited information "
"about the classes, methods and top-level functions defined in a module.  The"
" information provided is sufficient to implement a traditional three-pane "
"class browser.  The information is extracted from the source code rather "
"than by importing the module, so this module is safe to use with untrusted "
"code.  This restriction makes it impossible to use this module with modules "
"not implemented in Python, including all standard and optional extension "
"modules."

"Read a module and return a dictionary mapping class names to class "
"descriptor objects.  The parameter *module* should be the name of a module "
"as a string; it may be the name of a module within a package.  The *path* "
"parameter should be a sequence, and is used to augment the value of "
"``sys.path``, which is used to locate module source code."

"Like :func:`readmodule`, but the returned dictionary, in addition to mapping"
" class names to class descriptor objects, also maps top-level function names"
" to function descriptor objects.  Moreover, if the module being read is a "
"package, the key ``'__path__'`` in the returned dictionary has as its value "
"a list which contains the package search path."
