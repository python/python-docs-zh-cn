"The :mod:`http.cookiejar` module defines classes for automatic handling of "
"HTTP cookies.  It is useful for accessing web sites that require small "

"either as Netscape or RFC 2965 cookies according to the 'policy' in effect. "
"Note that the great majority of cookies on the Internet are Netscape "
"cookies. :mod:`http.cookiejar` attempts to follow the de-facto Netscape "
