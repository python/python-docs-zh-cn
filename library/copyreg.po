"The :mod:`copyreg` module offers a way to define functions used while "
"pickling specific objects.  The :mod:`pickle` and :mod:`copy` modules use "
"those functions when pickling/copying those objects.  The module provides "
"configuration information about object constructors which are not classes. "
"Such constructors may be factory functions or class instances."

"Declares *object* to be a valid constructor.  If *object* is not callable "
"(and hence not valid as a constructor), raises :exc:`TypeError`."

"Declares that *function* should be used as a \"reduction\" function for "
"objects of type *type*.  *function* should return either a string or a tuple"

"The optional *constructor* parameter, if provided, is a callable object "
"which can be used to reconstruct the object when called with the tuple of "
"arguments returned by *function* at pickling time.  :exc:`TypeError` will be"
" raised if *object* is a class or *constructor* is not callable."

"See the :mod:`pickle` module for more details on the interface expected of "
"*function* and *constructor*.  Note that the "
":attr:`~pickle.Pickler.dispatch_table` attribute of a pickler object or "
"subclass of :class:`pickle.Pickler` can also be used for declaring reduction"
" functions."
