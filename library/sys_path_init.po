"A module search path is initialized when Python starts. This module search "
"path may be accessed at :data:`sys.path`."

"The first entry in the module search path is the directory that contains the"
" input script, if there is one. Otherwise, the first entry is the current "
"directory, which is the case when executing the interactive shell, a "
":option:`-c` command, or :option:`-m` module."

"The :envvar:`PYTHONPATH` environment variable is often used to add "
"directories to the search path. If this environment variable is found then "
"the contents are added to the module search path."

":envvar:`PYTHONPATH` will affect all installed Python versions/environments."
" Be wary of setting this in your shell profile or global environment "
"variables. The :mod:`site` module offers more nuanced techniques as "
"mentioned below."
msgstr ""

"The next items added are the directories containing standard Python modules "
"as well as any :term:`extension module`\\s that these modules depend on. "
"Extension modules are ``.pyd`` files on Windows and ``.so`` files on other "
"platforms. The directory with the platform-independent Python modules is "
"called ``prefix``. The directory with the extension modules is called "
"``exec_prefix``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/sys_path_init.rst:30
msgid ""
"The :envvar:`PYTHONHOME` environment variable may be used to set the "
"``prefix`` and ``exec_prefix`` locations. Otherwise these directories are "
"found by using the Python executable as a starting point and then looking "
"for various 'landmark' files and directories. Note that any symbolic links "
"are followed so the real Python executable location is used as the search "
"starting point. The Python executable location is called ``home``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/sys_path_init.rst:37
msgid ""
"Once ``home`` is determined, the ``prefix`` directory is found by first "
"looking for :file:`python{majorversion}{minorversion}.zip` "
"(``python311.zip``). On Windows the zip archive is searched for in ``home`` "
"and on Unix the archive is expected to be in :file:`lib`. Note that the "
"expected zip archive location is added to the module search path even if the"
" archive does not exist. If no archive was found, Python on Windows will "
"continue the search for ``prefix`` by looking for :file:`Lib\\\\os.py`. "
"Python on Unix will look for "
":file:`lib/python{majorversion}.{minorversion}/os.py` "
"(``lib/python3.11/os.py``). On Windows ``prefix`` and ``exec_prefix`` are "
"the same, however on other platforms "
":file:`lib/python{majorversion}.{minorversion}/lib-dynload` "
"(``lib/python3.11/lib-dynload``) is searched for and used as an anchor for "
"``exec_prefix``. On some platforms :file:`lib` may be :file:`lib64` or "
"another value, see :data:`sys.platlibdir` and :envvar:`PYTHONPLATLIBDIR`."

"Finally, the :mod:`site` module is processed and :file:`site-packages` "
"directories are added to the module search path. A common way to customize "
"the search path is to create :mod:`sitecustomize` or :mod:`usercustomize` "
"modules as described in the :mod:`site` module documentation."

msgid ""
"To completely override :data:`sys.path` create a ``._pth`` file with the "
"same name as the shared library or executable (``python._pth`` or "
"``python311._pth``). The shared library path is always known on Windows, "
"however it may not be available on other platforms. In the ``._pth`` file "
"specify one line for each path to add to :data:`sys.path`. The file based on"
" the shared library name overrides the one based on the executable, which "
"allows paths to be restricted for any program loading the runtime if "
"desired."

"When the file exists, all registry and environment variables are ignored, "
"isolated mode is enabled, and :mod:`site` is not imported unless one line in"

"the file. Import statements other than to ``site`` are not permitted, and "
"arbitrary code cannot be specified."
