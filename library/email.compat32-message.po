"An email message consists of *headers* and a *payload*.  Headers must be "
":rfc:`5322` style names and values, where the field name and value are "
"separated by a colon.  The colon is not part of either the field name or the"
" field value.  The payload may be a simple text message, or a binary object,"
" or a structured sequence of sub-messages each with their own set of headers"
