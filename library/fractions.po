"The first version requires that *numerator* and *denominator* are instances "
"of :class:`numbers.Rational` and returns a new :class:`Fraction` instance "
"with value ``numerator/denominator``. If *denominator* is :const:`0`, it "
"raises a :exc:`ZeroDivisionError`. The second version requires that "
"*other_fraction* is an instance of :class:`numbers.Rational` and returns a "
":class:`Fraction` instance with the same value.  The next two versions "
"accept either a :class:`float` or a :class:`decimal.Decimal` instance, and "
"return a :class:`Fraction` instance with exactly the same value.  Note that "
"due to the usual issues with binary floating-point (see :ref:`tut-fp-"
"issues`), the argument to ``Fraction(1.1)`` is not exactly equal to 11/10, "
"and so ``Fraction(1.1)`` does *not* return ``Fraction(11, 10)`` as one might"
" expect. (But see the documentation for the :meth:`limit_denominator` method"
" below.) The last version of the constructor expects a string or unicode "
"instance. The usual form for this instance is::"
