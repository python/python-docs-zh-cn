"The :mod:`xml.dom.pulldom` module provides a \"pull parser\" which can also "
"be asked to produce DOM-accessible fragments of the document where "
"necessary. The basic concept involves pulling \"events\" from a stream of "
"incoming XML and processing them. In contrast to SAX which also employs an "
"event-driven processing model together with callbacks, the user of a pull "
"parser is responsible for explicitly pulling events from the stream, looping"
" over those events until either processing is finished or an error condition"
" occurs."

"Since the document is treated as a \"flat\" stream of events, the document "

"consider hierarchical issues such as recursive searching of the document "
"nodes, although if the context of elements were important, one would either "
"need to maintain some context-related state (i.e. remembering where one is "
"in the document at any given point) or to make use of the "
":func:`DOMEventStream.expandNode` method and switch to DOM-related "
