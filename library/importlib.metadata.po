"``importlib.metadata`` is a library that provides for access to installed "
"package metadata.  Built in part on Python's import system, this library "
"intends to replace similar functionality in the `entry point API`_ and "
"`metadata API`_ of ``pkg_resources``.  Along with :mod:`importlib.resources`"
" in Python 3.7 and newer (backported as `importlib_resources`_ for older "
"versions of Python), this can eliminate the need to use the older and less "
"efficient ``pkg_resources`` package."

"By \"installed package\" we generally mean a third-party package installed "
"into Python's ``site-packages`` directory via tools such as `pip "
"<https://pypi.org/project/pip/>`_.  Specifically, it means a package with "
"either a discoverable ``dist-info`` or ``egg-info`` directory, and metadata "
"defined by :pep:`566` or its older specifications. By default, package "
"metadata can live on the file system or in zip archives on :data:`sys.path`."
"  Through an extension mechanism, the metadata can live almost anywhere."
