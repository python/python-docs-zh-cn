"``importlib.metadata`` is a library that provides access to the metadata of "
"an installed `Distribution Package "
"<https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/glossary/#term-Distribution-"
"Package>`_, such as its entry points or its top-level names (`Import Package"
" <https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/glossary/#term-Import-"
"Package>`_\\s, modules, if any). Built in part on Python's import system, "
"this library intends to replace similar functionality in the `entry point "
"API`_ and `metadata API`_ of ``pkg_resources``.  Along with "
":mod:`importlib.resources`, this package can eliminate the need to use the "
"older and less efficient ``pkg_resources`` package."
