":mod:`multiprocessing` is a package that supports spawning processes using "
"an API similar to the :mod:`threading` module.  The :mod:`multiprocessing` "
"package offers both local and remote concurrency, effectively side-stepping "
"the :term:`Global Interpreter Lock <global interpreter lock>` by using "
"subprocesses instead of threads.  Due to this, the :mod:`multiprocessing` "
"module allows the programmer to fully leverage multiple processors on a "
"given machine.  It runs on both Unix and Windows."

"The :mod:`multiprocessing` module also introduces APIs which do not have "
"analogs in the :mod:`threading` module.  A prime example of this is the "
":class:`~multiprocessing.pool.Pool` object which offers a convenient means "
"of parallelizing the execution of a function across multiple input values, "
"distributing the input data across processes (data parallelism).  The "
"following example demonstrates the common practice of defining such "
"functions in a module so that child processes can successfully import that "
"module.  This basic example of data parallelism using "
