"When invoked from the command line, ``python -m pickletools`` will "
"disassemble the contents of one or more pickle files.  Note that if you want"
" to see the Python object stored in the pickle rather than the details of "
"pickle format, you may want to use ``-m pickle`` instead. However, when the "
"pickle file that you want to examine comes from an untrusted source, ``-m "
"pickletools`` is a safer option because it does not execute pickle bytecode."

"Outputs a symbolic disassembly of the pickle to the file-like object *out*, "
"defaulting to ``sys.stdout``.  *pickle* can be a string or a file-like "
"object.  *memo* can be a Python dictionary that will be used as the pickle's"
" memo; it can be used to perform disassemblies across multiple pickles "
"created by the same pickler. Successive levels, indicated by ``MARK`` "
"opcodes in the stream, are indented by *indentlevel* spaces.  If a nonzero "
"value is given to *annotate*, each opcode in the output is annotated with a "
"short description.  The value of *annotate* is used as a hint for the column"

"Provides an :term:`iterator` over all of the opcodes in a pickle, returning "
