"This module provides low-level primitives for working with multiple threads "
"(also called :dfn:`light-weight processes` or :dfn:`tasks`) --- multiple "
"threads of control sharing their global data space.  For synchronization, "
"simple locks (also called :dfn:`mutexes` or :dfn:`binary semaphores`) are "
"provided. The :mod:`threading` module provides an easier to use and higher-"
"level threading API built on top of this module."
