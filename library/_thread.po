msgstr ""

#: ../../library/_thread.rst:15
msgid ""
"This module provides low-level primitives for working with multiple threads "
"(also called :dfn:`light-weight processes` or :dfn:`tasks`) --- multiple "
"threads of control sharing their global data space.  For synchronization, "
"simple locks (also called :dfn:`mutexes` or :dfn:`binary semaphores`) are "
"provided. The :mod:`threading` module provides an easier to use and higher-"
"level threading API built on top of this module."

"The module is optional.  It is supported on Windows, Linux, SGI IRIX, "
"Solaris 2.x, as well as on systems that have a POSIX thread (a.k.a. "
"\"pthread\") implementation.  For systems lacking the :mod:`_thread` module,"
" the :mod:`_dummy_thread` module is available. It duplicates this module's "
"interface and can be used as a drop-in replacement."

"Start a new thread and return its identifier.  The thread executes the "

"The optional *kwargs* argument specifies a dictionary of keyword arguments. "
"When the function returns, the thread silently exits.  When the function "
"terminates with an unhandled exception, a stack trace is printed and then "
"the thread exits (but other threads continue to run)."

"Return the thread stack size used when creating new threads.  The optional "
"*size* argument specifies the stack size to be used for subsequently created"
" threads, and must be 0 (use platform or configured default) or a positive "
"integer value of at least 32,768 (32 KiB). If *size* is not specified, 0 is "
"used.  If changing the thread stack size is unsupported, a "
":exc:`RuntimeError` is raised.  If the specified stack size is invalid, a "
":exc:`ValueError` is raised and the stack size is unmodified.  32 KiB is "
"currently the minimum supported stack size value to guarantee sufficient "
"stack space for the interpreter itself.  Note that some platforms may have "
"particular restrictions on values for the stack size, such as requiring a "
"minimum stack size > 32 KiB or requiring allocation in multiples of the "
"system memory page size - platform documentation should be referred to for "
"more information (4 KiB pages are common; using multiples of 4096 for the "
"stack size is the suggested approach in the absence of more specific "
"information). Availability: Windows, systems with POSIX threads."
