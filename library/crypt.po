"This module implements an interface to the :manpage:`crypt(3)` routine, "
"which is a one-way hash function based upon a modified DES algorithm; see "
"the Unix man page for further details.  Possible uses include storing hashed"
" passwords so you can check passwords without storing the actual password, "
"or attempting to crack Unix passwords with a dictionary."

"Notice that the behavior of this module depends on the actual implementation"
"  of the :manpage:`crypt(3)` routine in the running system.  Therefore, any "
"extensions available on the current implementation will also  be available "
"on this module."

#: ../../library/crypt.rst:81
msgid ""
"*word* will usually be a user's password as typed at a prompt or  in a "
"graphical interface.  The optional *salt* is either a string as returned "
"from :func:`mksalt`, one of the ``crypt.METHOD_*`` values (though not all "
"may be available on all platforms), or a full encrypted password including "
"salt, as returned by this function.  If *salt* is not provided, the "
"strongest method will be used (as returned by :func:`methods`."
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/crypt.rst:89
msgid ""
"Checking a password is usually done by passing the plain-text password as "
"*word* and the full results of a previous :func:`crypt` call, which should "
"be the same as the results of this call."
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/crypt.rst:93
msgid ""
"*salt* (either a random 2 or 16 character string, possibly prefixed with "
"``$digit$`` to indicate the method) which will be used to perturb the "
"encryption algorithm.  The characters in *salt* must be in the set "
"``[./a-zA-Z0-9]``, with the exception of Modular Crypt Format which prefixes"
" a ``$digit$``."

#: ../../library/crypt.rst:99
msgid ""
"Returns the hashed password as a string, which will be composed of "
"characters from the same alphabet as the salt."
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/crypt.rst:104
msgid ""
"Since a few :manpage:`crypt(3)` extensions allow different values, with "
"different sizes in the *salt*, it is recommended to use  the full crypted "
"password as salt when checking for a password."
