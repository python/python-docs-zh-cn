"It starts by constructing up to four directories from a head and a tail "

"empty heads are skipped.  For the tail part, it uses the empty string and "
"then :file:`lib/site-packages` (on Windows) or :file:`lib/python{X.Y}/site-"
"packages` (on Unix and macOS).  For each of the distinct head-tail "
"combinations, it sees if it refers to an existing directory, and if so, adds"

"An executable line in a :file:`.pth` file is run at every Python startup, "
"regardless of whether a particular module is actually going to be used. Its "
"impact should thus be kept to a minimum. The primary intended purpose of "
"executable lines is to make the corresponding module(s) importable (load "
"3rd-party import hooks, adjust :envvar:`PATH` etc). Any other initialization"
" is supposed to be done upon a module's actual import, if and when it "
"happens. Limiting a code chunk to a single line is a deliberate measure to "
"discourage putting anything more complex here."
