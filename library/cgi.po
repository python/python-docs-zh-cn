"The problem with the code is that you should never expect that a client will"

" crash, because in this situation the ``getvalue(\"user\")`` method call "
"returns a list instead of a string.  Calling the :meth:`~str.upper` method "
"on a list is not valid (since lists do not have a method of this name) and "
"results in an :exc:`AttributeError` exception."
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/cgi.rst:237

"Therefore, the appropriate way to read form data values was to always use "
"the code which checks whether the obtained value is a single value or a list"
