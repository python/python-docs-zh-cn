"Most often, CGI scripts live in the server's special :file:`cgi-bin` "
"directory. The HTTP server places all sorts of information about the request"

"lots of other goodies) in the script's shell environment, executes the "
"script, and sends the script's output back to the client."

"The script's input is connected to the client too, and sometimes the form "
"data is read this way; at other times the form data is passed via the "

"the different cases and provide a simpler interface to the Python script.  "
"It also provides a number of utilities that help in debugging scripts, and "
"the latest addition is support for file uploads from a form (if your browser"

"The output of a CGI script should consist of two sections, separated by a "

"contained in the META tag in the HEAD section of the HTML document or by the"
" :mailheader:`Content-Type` header).  This reads the form contents from the "
"standard input or the environment (depending on the value of various "
"environment variables set according to the CGI standard).  Since it may "
"consume standard input, it should be instantiated only once."

"The :class:`FieldStorage` instance can be indexed like a Python dictionary. "
"It allows membership testing with the :keyword:`in` operator, and also "

"function :func:`len`.  Form fields containing empty strings are ignored and "

"Here the fields, accessed through ``form[key]``, are themselves instances of"
" :class:`FieldStorage` (or :class:`MiniFieldStorage`, depending on the form "
"encoding). The :attr:`~FieldStorage.value` attribute of the instance yields "

" in this situation, ``form.getvalue(key)`` would return a list of strings. "
"If you expect this possibility (when your HTML form contains multiple fields"
" with the same name), use the :meth:`~FieldStorage.getlist` method, which "
"always returns a list of values (so that you do not need to special-case the"

"The previous section explains how to read CGI form data using the "
":class:`FieldStorage` class.  This section describes a higher level "
"interface which was added to this class to allow one to do it in a more "
"readable and intuitive way.  The interface doesn't make the techniques "
"described in previous sections obsolete --- they are still useful to process"
" file uploads efficiently, for example."
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/cgi.rst:204
msgid ""
"The interface consists of two simple methods. Using the methods you can "
"process form data in a generic way, without the need to worry whether only "
"one or more values were posted under one name."

msgid ""
"In the previous section, you learned to write following code anytime you "

"This situation is common for example when a form contains a group of "
"multiple checkboxes with the same name::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/cgi.rst:223
msgid ""
"In most situations, however, there's only one form control with a particular"
" name in a form and then you expect and need only one value associated with "
"this name.  So you write a script containing for example this code::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/cgi.rst:229
msgid ""
"The problem with the code is that you should never expect that a client will"
" provide valid input to your scripts.  For example, if a curious user "
"appends another ``user=foo`` pair to the query string, then the script would"
" crash, because in this situation the ``getvalue(\"user\")`` method call "
"returns a list instead of a string.  Calling the :meth:`~str.upper` method "
"on a list is not valid (since lists do not have a method of this name) and "
"results in an :exc:`AttributeError` exception."
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/cgi.rst:237
msgid ""
"Therefore, the appropriate way to read form data values was to always use "
"the code which checks whether the obtained value is a single value or a list"
" of values.  That's annoying and leads to less readable scripts."
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/cgi.rst:241
msgid ""
"A more convenient approach is to use the methods "
":meth:`~FieldStorage.getfirst` and :meth:`~FieldStorage.getlist` provided by"
" this higher level interface."
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/cgi.rst:247
msgid ""
"This method always returns only one value associated with form field *name*."
" The method returns only the first value in case that more values were "
"posted under such name.  Please note that the order in which the values are "
"received may vary from browser to browser and should not be counted on. [#]_"
"  If no such form field or value exists then the method returns the value "
"specified by the optional parameter *default*.  This parameter defaults to "
"``None`` if not specified."
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/cgi.rst:258
msgid ""
"This method always returns a list of values associated with form field "
