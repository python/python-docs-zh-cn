"This module defines two classes, :class:`Mailbox` and :class:`Message`, for "
"accessing and manipulating on-disk mailboxes and the messages they contain. "
":class:`Mailbox` offers a dictionary-like mapping from keys to messages. "
":class:`Message` extends the :mod:`email.message` module's "
":class:`~email.message.Message` class with format-specific state and "
"behavior. Supported mailbox formats are Maildir, mbox, MH, Babyl, and MMDF."

"The :class:`Mailbox` interface is dictionary-like, with small keys "

":class:`Mailbox` interface semantics differ from dictionary semantics in "
"some noteworthy ways. Each time a message is requested, a new representation"
" (typically a :class:`Message` instance) is generated based upon the current"
" state of the mailbox. Similarly, when a message is added to a "
":class:`Mailbox` instance, the provided message representation's contents "
"are copied. In neither case is a reference to the message representation "
"kept by the :class:`Mailbox` instance."

"The default :class:`Mailbox` iterator iterates over message representations,"
" not keys as the default dictionary iterator does. Moreover, modification of"
" a mailbox during iteration is safe and well-defined. Messages added to the "
"mailbox after an iterator is created will not be seen by the iterator. "
"Messages removed from the mailbox before the iterator yields them will be "

":exc:`KeyError` exception if the corresponding message is subsequently "
"removed."

"Be very cautious when modifying mailboxes that might be simultaneously "

"calling the :meth:`lock` and :meth:`unlock` methods *before* reading any "
