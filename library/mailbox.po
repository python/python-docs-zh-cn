"This module defines two classes, :class:`Mailbox` and :class:`Message`, for "
"accessing and manipulating on-disk mailboxes and the messages they contain. "
":class:`!Mailbox` offers a dictionary-like mapping from keys to messages. "
":class:`!Message` extends the :mod:`email.message` module's "
":class:`~email.message.Message` class with format-specific state and "
"behavior. Supported mailbox formats are Maildir, mbox, MH, Babyl, and MMDF."

"The :class:`!Mailbox` interface is dictionary-like, with small keys "
"corresponding to messages. Keys are issued by the :class:`!Mailbox` instance"

#: ../../library/mailbox.rst:51
msgid ""
":class:`!Mailbox` interface semantics differ from dictionary semantics in "
"some noteworthy ways. Each time a message is requested, a new representation"
" (typically a :class:`Message` instance) is generated based upon the current"
" state of the mailbox. Similarly, when a message is added to a "
":class:`!Mailbox` instance, the provided message representation's contents "
"are copied. In neither case is a reference to the message representation "
"kept by the :class:`!Mailbox` instance."

"The default :class:`!Mailbox` :term:`iterator` iterates over message "
"representations, not keys as the default :class:`dictionary <dict>` iterator"
" does. Moreover, modification of a mailbox during iteration is safe and "
"well-defined. Messages added to the mailbox after an iterator is created "
"will not be seen by the iterator. Messages removed from the mailbox before "
"the iterator yields them will be silently skipped, though using a key from "

"*must* lock it by calling the :meth:`lock` and :meth:`unlock` methods "
