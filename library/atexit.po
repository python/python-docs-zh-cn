msgid ""
"The :mod:`atexit` module defines functions to register and unregister "
"cleanup functions.  Functions thus registered are automatically executed "
"upon normal interpreter termination.  :mod:`atexit` runs these functions in "
"the *reverse* order in which they were registered; if you register ``A``, "
"``B``, and ``C``, at interpreter termination time they will be run in the "
"order ``C``, ``B``, ``A``."

#: ../../library/atexit.rst:19

"**Note:** The functions registered via this module are not called when the "
"program is killed by a signal not handled by Python, when a Python fatal "
"internal error is detected, or when :func:`os._exit` is called."

"Register *func* as a function to be executed at termination.  Any optional "
"arguments that are to be passed to *func* must be passed as arguments to "
":func:`register`.  It is possible to register the same function and "
"arguments more than once."
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/atexit.rst:31
msgid ""
"At normal program termination (for instance, if :func:`sys.exit` is called "
"or the main module's execution completes), all functions registered are "
"called in last in, first out order.  The assumption is that lower level "
"modules will normally be imported before higher level modules and thus must "
"be cleaned up later."

msgid ""
"If an exception is raised during execution of the exit handlers, a traceback"
" is printed (unless :exc:`SystemExit` is raised) and the exception "
"information is saved.  After all exit handlers have had a chance to run the "
"last exception to be raised is re-raised."

"Remove *func* from the list of functions to be run at interpreter shutdown."
"  After calling :func:`unregister`, *func* is guaranteed not to be called "
"when the interpreter shuts down, even if it was registered more than once.  "
":func:`unregister` silently does nothing if *func* was not previously "
