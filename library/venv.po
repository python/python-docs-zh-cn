"circumstances to activate a virtual environment—scripts installed into "
"virtual environments have a \"shebang\" line which points to the virtual "
"environment's Python interpreter. This means that the script will run with "
"that interpreter regardless of the value of ``PATH``. On Windows, "
"\"shebang\" line processing is supported if you have the Python Launcher for"
" Windows installed (this was added to Python in 3.3 - see :pep:`397` for "
