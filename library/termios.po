"This module provides an interface to the POSIX calls for tty I/O control. "
"For a complete description of these calls, see :manpage:`termios(3)` Unix "
"manual page.  It is only available for those Unix versions that support "
"POSIX *termios* style tty I/O control configured during installation."

"All functions in this module take a file descriptor *fd* as their first "
"argument.  This can be an integer file descriptor, such as returned by "
"``sys.stdin.fileno()``, or a :term:`file object`, such as ``sys.stdin`` "
"itself."

"This module also defines all the constants needed to work with the functions"
" provided here; these have the same name as their counterparts in C.  Please"

"Return a list containing the tty attributes for file descriptor *fd*, as "
"follows: ``[iflag, oflag, cflag, lflag, ispeed, ospeed, cc]`` where *cc* is "
"a list of the tty special characters (each a string of length 1, except the "
"items with indices :const:`VMIN` and :const:`VTIME`, which are integers when"
" these fields are defined).  The interpretation of the flags and the speeds "
"as well as the indexing in the *cc* array must be done using the symbolic "
"constants defined in the :mod:`termios` module."
