"The :mod:`pty` module defines operations for handling the pseudo-terminal "
"concept: starting another process and being able to write to and read from "
"its controlling terminal programmatically."

"Because pseudo-terminal handling is highly platform dependent, there is code"
" to do it only for Linux. (The Linux code is supposed to work on other "
"platforms, but hasn't been tested yet.)"

msgid "The :mod:`pty` module defines the following functions:"

"Fork. Connect the child's controlling terminal to a pseudo-terminal. Return "
"value is ``(pid, fd)``. Note that the child  gets *pid* 0, and the *fd* is "
"*invalid*. The parent's return value is the *pid* of the child, and *fd* is "
"a file descriptor connected to the child's controlling terminal (and also to"
" the child's standard input and output)."

msgid ""
"Open a new pseudo-terminal pair, using :func:`os.openpty` if possible, or "
"emulation code for generic Unix systems. Return a pair of file descriptors "
"``(master, slave)``, for the master and the slave end, respectively."

"Spawn a process, and connect its controlling terminal with the current "
"process's standard io. This is often used to baffle programs which insist on"
" reading from the controlling terminal."

"The functions *master_read* and *stdin_read* should be functions which read "
"from a file descriptor. The defaults try to read 1024 bytes each time they "

":func:`spawn` now returns the status value from :func:`os.waitpid` on the "
