"The :mod:`pty` module defines operations for handling the pseudo-terminal "

"Pseudo-terminal handling is highly platform dependent. This code is mainly "
"tested on Linux, FreeBSD, and macOS (it is supposed to work on other POSIX "

msgid "The :mod:`pty` module defines the following functions:"

#: ../../library/pty.rst:30
msgid ""
"Fork. Connect the child's controlling terminal to a pseudo-terminal. Return "
"value is ``(pid, fd)``. Note that the child  gets *pid* 0, and the *fd* is "
"*invalid*. The parent's return value is the *pid* of the child, and *fd* is "
"a file descriptor connected to the child's controlling terminal (and also to"
" the child's standard input and output)."

msgid ""
"On macOS the use of this function is unsafe when mixed with using higher-"
"level system APIs, and that includes using :mod:`urllib.request`."

msgid ""
"Open a new pseudo-terminal pair, using :func:`os.openpty` if possible, or "
"emulation code for generic Unix systems. Return a pair of file descriptors "
"``(master, slave)``, for the master and the slave end, respectively."

#: ../../library/pty.rst:49
msgid ""
"Spawn a process, and connect its controlling terminal with the current "
"process's standard io. This is often used to baffle programs which insist on"
" reading from the controlling terminal. It is expected that the process "
"spawned behind the pty will eventually terminate, and when it does *spawn* "
"will return."

"A loop copies STDIN of the current process to the child and data received "

"child if STDIN of the current process closes down."

"The functions *master_read* and *stdin_read* are passed a file descriptor "
"which they should read from, and they should always return a byte string. In"
" order to force spawn to return before the child process exits an empty byte"
" array should be returned to signal end of file."
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/pty.rst:64
msgid ""
"The default implementation for both functions will read and return up to "
"1024 bytes each time the function is called. The *master_read* callback is "
"passed the pseudoterminalâ€™s master file descriptor to read output from the "
"child process, and *stdin_read* is passed file descriptor 0, to read from "
"the parent process's standard input."
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/pty.rst:70
msgid ""
"Returning an empty byte string from either callback is interpreted as an "
"end-of-file (EOF) condition, and that callback will not be called after "
"that. If *stdin_read* signals EOF the controlling terminal can no longer "
"communicate with the parent process OR the child process. Unless the child "
"process will quit without any input, *spawn* will then loop forever. If "
"*master_read* signals EOF the same behavior results (on linux at least)."
