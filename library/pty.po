msgid ""
"The :mod:`pty` module defines operations for handling the pseudo-terminal "
"concept: starting another process and being able to write to and read from "
"its controlling terminal programmatically."
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/pty.rst:19
msgid ""
"Because pseudo-terminal handling is highly platform dependent, there is code"
" to do it only for Linux. (The Linux code is supposed to work on other "
"platforms, but hasn't been tested yet.)"
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/pty.rst:23
msgid "The :mod:`pty` module defines the following functions:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/pty.rst:28
msgid ""
"Fork. Connect the child's controlling terminal to a pseudo-terminal. Return "
"value is ``(pid, fd)``. Note that the child  gets *pid* 0, and the *fd* is "
"*invalid*. The parent's return value is the *pid* of the child, and *fd* is "
"a file descriptor connected to the child's controlling terminal (and also to"
" the child's standard input and output)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/pty.rst:37
msgid ""
"Open a new pseudo-terminal pair, using :func:`os.openpty` if possible, or "
"emulation code for generic Unix systems. Return a pair of file descriptors "
"``(master, slave)``, for the master and the slave end, respectively."
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/pty.rst:44
msgid ""
"Spawn a process, and connect its controlling terminal with the current "
"process's standard io. This is often used to baffle programs which insist on"
" reading from the controlling terminal. It is expected that the process "
"spawned behind the pty will eventually terminate, and when it does *spawn* "
"will return."
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/pty.rst:50
msgid ""
"The functions *master_read* and *stdin_read* are passed a file descriptor "
"which they should read from, and they should always return a byte string. In"
" order to force spawn to return before the child process exits an "
":exc:`OSError` should be thrown."
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/pty.rst:55
msgid ""
"The default implementation for both functions will read and return up to "
"1024 bytes each time the function is called. The *master_read* callback is "
"passed the pseudoterminalâ€™s master file descriptor to read output from the "
"child process, and *stdin_read* is passed file descriptor 0, to read from "
"the parent process's standard input."
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/pty.rst:61
msgid ""
"Returning an empty byte string from either callback is interpreted as an "
"end-of-file (EOF) condition, and that callback will not be called after "
"that. If *stdin_read* signals EOF the controlling terminal can no longer "
"communicate with the parent process OR the child process. Unless the child "
"process will quit without any input, *spawn* will then loop forever. If "
"*master_read* signals EOF the same behavior results (on linux at least)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/pty.rst:68
msgid ""
"If both callbacks signal EOF then *spawn* will probably never return, unless"
" *select* throws an error on your platform when passed three empty lists. "
"This is a bug, documented in `issue 26228 "
"<https://bugs.python.org/issue26228>`_."

":func:`waitstatus_to_exitcode` can be used to convert the exit status into "
"an exit code."
