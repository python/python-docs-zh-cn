"It is preferred that tests that use the :mod:`unittest` module follow a few "

"the method is testing. This is needed so that the methods are recognized by "
"the test driver as test methods. Also, no documentation string for the "
"method should be included. A comment (such as ``# Tests function returns "

"The :mod:`test` package can be run as a script to drive Python's regression "

"test.regrtest` used in previous Python versions still works.  Running the "
"script by itself automatically starts running all regression tests in the "
":mod:`test` package. It does this by finding all modules in the package "
"whose name starts with ``test_``, importing them, and executing the function"
" :func:`test_main` if present or loading the tests via "
"unittest.TestLoader.loadTestsFromModule if ``test_main`` does not exist.  "
