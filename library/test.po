"The :mod:`test` package is meant for internal use by Python only. It is "

"The :mod:`test` package contains all regression tests for Python as well as "

" drives the testing suite."

"It is preferred that tests that use the :mod:`unittest` module follow a few "
"guidelines. One is to name the test module by starting it with ``test_`` and"
" end it with the name of the module being tested. The test methods in the "
"test module should start with ``test_`` and end with a description of what "
"the method is testing. This is needed so that the methods are recognized by "
"the test driver as test methods. Also, no documentation string for the "
"method should be included. A comment (such as ``# Tests function returns "
"only True or False``) should be used to provide documentation for test "
"methods. This is done because documentation strings get printed out if they "

"The :mod:`test` package can be run as a script to drive Python's regression "

"test.regrtest` used in previous Python versions still works.  Running the "
"script by itself automatically starts running all regression tests in the "
":mod:`test` package. It does this by finding all modules in the package "
"whose name starts with ``test_``, importing them, and executing the function"
" :func:`test_main` if present or loading the tests via "
"unittest.TestLoader.loadTestsFromModule if ``test_main`` does not exist.  "

"resources: :program:`python -m test -uall`. If all but one resource is "
