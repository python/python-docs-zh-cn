"It is preferred that tests that use the :mod:`unittest` module follow a few "

"test module should start with ``test_`` and end with a description of what "
"the method is testing. This is needed so that the methods are recognized by "
"the test driver as test methods. Also, no documentation string for the "
"method should be included. A comment (such as ``# Tests function returns "
"only True or False``) should be used to provide documentation for test "
"methods. This is done because documentation strings get printed out if they "

"使用 :mod:`unittest` 模块的测试最好是遵循一些准则。 其中一条是测试模块的名称要以 ``test_`` 打头并以被测试模块的名称结尾。 "
