"wxPython is a cross-platform GUI toolkit for Python that is built around the"

"toolkit.  It provides a native look and feel for applications on Windows, "
"Mac OS X, and Unix systems by using each platform's native widgets where "
"ever possible, (GTK+ on Unix-like systems).  In addition to an extensive set"
" of widgets, wxPython provides classes for online documentation and context "
"sensitive help, printing, HTML viewing, low-level device context drawing, "
"drag and drop, system clipboard access, an XML-based resource format and "
"more, including an ever growing library of user-contributed modules."

"PyGTK, PyQt, and wxPython, all have a modern look and feel and more widgets "

"<https://wiki.python.org/moin/GuiProgramming>`_ page in the Python Wiki for "
"a much more complete list, and also for links to documents where the "
"different GUI toolkits are compared."
