"The :mod:`parser` module provides an interface to Python's internal parser "
"and byte-code compiler.  The primary purpose for this interface is to allow "
"Python code to edit the parse tree of a Python expression and create "
"executable code from this.  This is better than trying to parse and modify "
"an arbitrary Python code fragment as a string because parsing is performed "
"in a manner identical to the code forming the application.  It is also "
"faster."

"The parser module is deprecated and will be removed in future versions of "
"Python. For the majority of use cases you can leverage the Abstract Syntax "
"Tree (AST) generation and compilation stage, using the :mod:`ast` module."

"There are a few things to note about this module which are important to "
"making use of the data structures created.  This is not a tutorial on "
"editing the parse trees for Python code, but some examples of using the "
":mod:`parser` module are presented."
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/parser.rst:39
msgid ""
"Most importantly, a good understanding of the Python grammar processed by "
"the internal parser is required.  For full information on the language "
"syntax, refer to :ref:`reference-index`.  The parser itself is created from "
"a grammar specification defined in the file :file:`Grammar/Grammar` in the "
"standard Python distribution.  The parse trees stored in the ST objects "
"created by this module are the actual output from the internal parser when "
"created by the :func:`expr` or :func:`suite` functions, described below.  "
"The ST objects created by :func:`sequence2st` faithfully simulate those "
"structures.  Be aware that the values of the sequences which are considered "
"\"correct\" will vary from one version of Python to another as the formal "
"grammar for the language is revised.  However, transporting code from one "
"Python version to another as source text will always allow correct parse "
"trees to be created in the target version, with the only restriction being "
"that migrating to an older version of the interpreter will not support more "
"recent language constructs.  The parse trees are not typically compatible "
"from one version to another, though source code has usually been forward-"
"compatible within a major release series."

"Each element of the sequences returned by :func:`st2list` or "
":func:`st2tuple` has a simple form.  Sequences representing non-terminal "
"elements in the grammar always have a length greater than one.  The first "
"element is an integer which identifies a production in the grammar.  These "
"integers are given symbolic names in the C header file "
":file:`Include/graminit.h` and the Python module :mod:`symbol`.  Each "
"additional element of the sequence represents a component of the production "
"as recognized in the input string: these are always sequences which have the"
" same form as the parent.  An important aspect of this structure which "
"should be noted is that keywords used to identify the parent node type, such"
" as the keyword :keyword:`if` in an :const:`if_stmt`, are included in the "
"node tree without any special treatment.  For example, the :keyword:`!if` "
"keyword is represented by the tuple ``(1, 'if')``, where ``1`` is the "
"numeric value associated with all :const:`NAME` tokens, including variable "
"and function names defined by the user.  In an alternate form returned when "
"line number information is requested, the same token might be represented as"
" ``(1, 'if', 12)``, where the ``12`` represents the line number at which the"
" terminal symbol was found."

"Terminal elements are represented in much the same way, but without any "
"child elements and the addition of the source text which was identified.  "

":file:`Include/token.h` and the Python module :mod:`token`."

"The ST objects are not required to support the functionality of this module,"
" but are provided for three purposes: to allow an application to amortize "
"the cost of processing complex parse trees, to provide a parse tree "
"representation which conserves memory space when compared to the Python list"
" or tuple representation, and to ease the creation of additional modules in "
"C which manipulate parse trees.  A simple \"wrapper\" class may be created "
"in Python to hide the use of ST objects."
