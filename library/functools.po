"The :mod:`functools` module is for higher-order functions: functions that "

"Transform an old-style comparison function to a :term:`key function`.  Used "

":func:`max`, :func:`heapq.nlargest`, :func:`heapq.nsmallest`, "
":func:`itertools.groupby`).  This function is primarily used as a transition"
" tool for programs being converted from Python 2 which supported the use of "
"comparison functions."

"A comparison function is any callable that accept two arguments, compares "
"them, and returns a negative number for less-than, zero for equality, or a "
"positive number for greater-than.  A key function is a callable that accepts"
" one argument and returns another value to be used as the sort key."

"Decorator to wrap a function with a memoizing callable that saves up to the "
"*maxsize* most recent calls.  It can save time when an expensive or I/O "

"If *typed* is set to true, function arguments of different types will be "

"To help measure the effectiveness of the cache and tune the *maxsize* "
