"The module :mod:`pdb` defines an interactive source code debugger for Python"
" programs.  It supports setting (conditional) breakpoints and single "
"stepping at the source line level, inspection of stack frames, source code "
"listing, and evaluation of arbitrary Python code in the context of any stack"
" frame.  It also supports post-mortem debugging and can be called under "
"program control."
