msgid ":mod:`gc` --- Garbage Collector interface"
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/gc.rst:12
msgid ""
"This module provides an interface to the optional garbage collector.  It "
"provides the ability to disable the collector, tune the collection "
"frequency, and set debugging options.  It also provides access to "
"unreachable objects that the collector found but cannot free.  Since the "
"collector supplements the reference counting already used in Python, you can"
" disable the collector if you are sure your program does not create "
"reference cycles.  Automatic collection can be disabled by calling "
"``gc.disable()``.  To debug a leaking program call "
"``gc.set_debug(gc.DEBUG_LEAK)``. Notice that this includes "
"``gc.DEBUG_SAVEALL``, causing garbage-collected objects to be saved in "
"gc.garbage for inspection."

"The free lists maintained for a number of built-in types are cleared "

"The GC classifies objects into three generations depending on how many "
"collection sweeps they have survived.  New objects are placed in the "
"youngest generation (generation ``0``).  If an object survives a collection "
"it is moved into the next older generation.  Since generation ``2`` is the "
"oldest generation, objects in that generation remain there after a "
"collection.  In order to decide when to run, the collector keeps track of "
"the number object allocations and deallocations since the last collection.  "
"When the number of allocations minus the number of deallocations exceeds "
"*threshold0*, collection starts.  Initially only generation ``0`` is "
"examined.  If generation ``0`` has been examined more than *threshold1* "
"times since generation ``1`` has been examined, then generation ``1`` is "
"examined as well.  Similarly, *threshold2* controls the number of "
"collections of generation ``1`` before collecting generation ``2``."
