"Although this module is always available, not all functions are available on"

"The :dfn:`epoch` is the point where the time starts, and is platform "

"**Year 2000 (Y2K) issues**: Python depends on the platform's C library, "
"which generally doesn't have year 2000 issues, since all dates and times are"
" represented internally as seconds since the epoch.  Function "
":func:`strptime` can parse 2-digit years when given ``%y`` format code.  "
"When 2-digit years are parsed, they are converted according to the POSIX and"
