"Mailcap files are used to configure how MIME-aware applications such as mail"
" readers and Web browsers react to files with different MIME types. (The "
"name \"mailcap\" is derived from the phrase \"mail capability\".)  For "
"example, a mailcap file might contain a line like ``video/mpeg; xmpeg %s``."
"  Then, if the user encounters an email message or Web document with the "
"MIME type :mimetype:`video/mpeg`, ``%s`` will be replaced by a filename "
"(usually one belonging to a temporary file) and the :program:`xmpeg` program"
" can be automatically started to view the file."

"The mailcap format is documented in :rfc:`1524`, \"A User Agent "
"Configuration Mechanism For Multimedia Mail Format Information,\" but is not"
" an Internet standard.  However, mailcap files are supported on most Unix "
"systems."

"Return a 2-tuple; the first element is a string containing the command line "
"to be executed (which can be passed to :func:`os.system`), and the second "
"element is the mailcap entry for a given MIME type.  If no matching MIME "
"type can be found, ``(None, None)`` is returned."

"*key* is the name of the field desired, which represents the type of "
"activity to be performed; the default value is 'view', since in the  most "
"common case you simply want to view the body of the MIME-typed data.  Other "
"possible values might be 'compose' and 'edit', if you wanted to create a new"
" body of the given MIME type or alter the existing body data.  See "
":rfc:`1524` for a complete list of these fields."

"*filename* is the filename to be substituted for ``%s`` in the command line;"
" the default value is ``'/dev/null'`` which is almost certainly not what you"
" want, so usually you'll override it by specifying a filename."

"*plist* can be a list containing named parameters; the default value is "
"simply an empty list.  Each entry in the list must be a string containing "
"the parameter name, an equals sign (``'='``), and the parameter's value.  "
"Mailcap entries can contain  named parameters like ``%{foo}``, which will be"
" replaced by the value of the parameter named 'foo'.  For example, if the "
"command line ``showpartial %{id} %{number} %{total}`` was in a mailcap file,"
" and *plist* was set to ``['id=1', 'number=2', 'total=3']``, the resulting "
"command line would be ``'showpartial 1 2 3'``."

"In a mailcap file, the \"test\" field can optionally be specified to test "
"some external condition (such as the machine architecture, or the window "

"entry if the check fails."
