"A \"shelf\" is a persistent, dictionary-like object.  The difference with "
"\"dbm\" databases is that the values (not the keys!) in a shelf can be "
"essentially arbitrary Python objects --- anything that the :mod:`pickle` "
"module can handle. This includes most class instances, recursive data types,"
" and objects containing lots of shared  sub-objects.  The keys are ordinary "
"strings."

"Open a persistent dictionary.  The filename specified is the base filename "
"for the underlying database.  As a side-effect, an extension may be added to"
" the filename and more than one file may be created.  By default, the "
"underlying database file is opened for reading and writing.  The optional "
"*flag* parameter has the same interpretation as the *flag* parameter of "
":func:`dbm.open`."

"Because of Python semantics, a shelf cannot know when a mutable persistent-"
"dictionary entry is modified.  By default modified objects are written "
"*only* when assigned to the shelf (see :ref:`shelve-example`).  If the "
"optional *writeback* parameter is set to ``True``, all entries accessed are "
"also cached in memory, and written back on :meth:`~Shelf.sync` and "
":meth:`~Shelf.close`; this can make it handier to mutate mutable entries in "
"the persistent dictionary, but, if many entries are accessed, it can consume"
" vast amounts of memory for the cache, and it can make the close operation "
"very slow since all accessed entries are written back (there is no way to "
"determine which accessed entries are mutable, nor which ones were actually "
"mutated)."

"Because the :mod:`shelve` module is backed by :mod:`pickle`, it is insecure "

"The choice of which database package will be used (such as :mod:`dbm.ndbm` "
"or :mod:`dbm.gnu`) depends on which interface is available.  Therefore it is"
" not safe to open the database directly using :mod:`dbm`.  The database is "
"also (unfortunately) subject to the limitations of :mod:`dbm`, if it is used"
" --- this means that (the pickled representation of) the objects stored in "
"the database should be fairly small, and in rare cases key collisions may "
"cause the database to refuse updates."
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/shelve.rst:109
msgid ""
"The :mod:`shelve` module does not support *concurrent* read/write access to "
"shelved objects.  (Multiple simultaneous read accesses are safe.)  When a "
"program has a shelf open for writing, no other program should have it open "
"for reading or writing.  Unix file locking can be used to solve this, but "
"this differs across Unix versions and requires knowledge about the database "
"implementation used."
