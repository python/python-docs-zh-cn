"The :mod:`tkinter.dnd` module provides drag-and-drop support for objects "
"within a single application, within the same window or between windows. To "
"enable an object to be dragged, you must create an event binding for it that"
" starts the drag-and-drop process. Typically, you bind a ButtonPress event "
"to a callback function that you write (see :ref:`Bindings-and-Events`). The "
"function should call :func:`dnd_start`, where 'source' is the object to be "
"dragged, and 'event' is the event that invoked the call (the argument to "
"your callback function)."
