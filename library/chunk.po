"Usually an IFF-type file consists of one or more chunks.  The proposed usage"

":meth:`~io.IOBase.seek` and :meth:`~io.IOBase.tell` are present and don't "
"raise an exception, they are also used. If these methods are present and "

"the optional argument *align* is true, chunks are assumed to be aligned on "

"chunk size is assumed to be in little-endian order. This is needed for WAVE "
