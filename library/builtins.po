msgid ""
"This module provides direct access to all 'built-in' identifiers of Python; "
"for example, ``builtins.open`` is the full name for the built-in function "
":func:`open`.  See :ref:`built-in-funcs` and :ref:`built-in-consts` for "
"documentation."

"This module is not normally accessed explicitly by most applications, but "
"can be useful in modules that provide objects with the same name as a built-"
"in value, but in which the built-in of that name is also needed.  For "
"example, in a module that wants to implement an :func:`open` function that "
"wraps the built-in :func:`open`, this module can be used directly::"

"As an implementation detail, most modules have the name ``__builtins__`` "
"made available as part of their globals.  The value of ``__builtins__`` is "
"normally either this module or the value of this module's "
":attr:`~object.__dict__` attribute. Since this is an implementation detail, "
"it may not be used by alternate implementations of Python."
