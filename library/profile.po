"and precise timings are made for the intervals between these events (during "
"which time the user's code is executing).  In contrast, :dfn:`statistical "
"profiling` (which is not done by this module) randomly samples the effective"
" instruction pointer, and deduces where time is being spent.  The latter "

#: ../../library/profile.rst:506
msgid ""
"In Python, since there is an interpreter active during execution, the "

"  Python automatically provides a :dfn:`hook` (optional callback) for each "
"event.  In addition, the interpreted nature of Python tends to add so much "
"overhead to execution, that deterministic profiling tends to only add small "
"processing overhead in typical applications.  The result is that "

"used to identify high level errors in the selection of algorithms.  Note "

msgid "Limitations"
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/profile.rst:530
msgid ""
"One limitation has to do with accuracy of timing information. There is a "
"fundamental problem with deterministic profilers involving accuracy.  The "
"most obvious restriction is that the underlying \"clock\" is only ticking at"
" a rate (typically) of about .001 seconds.  Hence no measurements will be "
"more accurate than the underlying clock.  If enough measurements are taken, "
"then the \"error\" will tend to average out. Unfortunately, removing this "
"first error induces a second source of error."
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/profile.rst:538
msgid ""
"The second problem is that it \"takes a while\" from when an event is "
"dispatched until the profiler's call to get the time actually *gets* the "
"state of the clock.  Similarly, there is a certain lag when exiting the "
"profiler event handler from the time that the clock's value was obtained "
"(and then squirreled away), until the user's code is once again executing.  "
"As a result, functions that are called many times, or call many functions, "
"will typically accumulate this error. The error that accumulates in this "
"fashion is typically less than the accuracy of the clock (less than one "
"clock tick), but it *can* accumulate and become very significant."
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/profile.rst:548
msgid ""
"The problem is more important with :mod:`profile` than with the lower-"
"overhead :mod:`cProfile`.  For this reason, :mod:`profile` provides a means "
"of calibrating itself for a given platform so that this error can be "
"probabilistically (on the average) removed. After the profiler is "
"calibrated, it will be more accurate (in a least square sense), but it will "
"sometimes produce negative numbers (when call counts are exceptionally low, "
"and the gods of probability work against you :-). )  Do *not* be alarmed by "
