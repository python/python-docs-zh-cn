":dfn:`Deterministic profiling` is meant to reflect the fact that all "

"and precise timings are made for the intervals between these events (during "
"which time the user's code is executing).  In contrast, :dfn:`statistical "
"profiling` (which is not done by this module) randomly samples the effective"
" instruction pointer, and deduces where time is being spent.  The latter "
"technique traditionally involves less overhead (as the code does not need to"

":dfn:`确定性性能分析` 旨在反映这样一个事实：即所有 *函数调用* 、 *函数返回* 和 *异常* "

"In Python, since there is an interpreter active during execution, the "
"presence of instrumented code is not required in order to do deterministic "

"add small processing overhead in typical applications.  The result is that "
"deterministic profiling is not that expensive, yet provides extensive run "
"time statistics about the execution of a Python program."

"One limitation has to do with accuracy of timing information. There is a "
"fundamental problem with deterministic profilers involving accuracy.  The "
"most obvious restriction is that the underlying \"clock\" is only ticking at"
" a rate (typically) of about .001 seconds.  Hence no measurements will be "
"more accurate than the underlying clock.  If enough measurements are taken, "
"then the \"error\" will tend to average out. Unfortunately, removing this "

"一个限制是关于时间信息的准确性。确定性性能分析存在一个涉及精度的基本问题。最明显的限制是，底层的 \"时钟\" "

"将趋于平均。不幸的是，删除第一个错误会导致第二个错误来源。"

#: ../../library/profile.rst:585
msgid ""
"The second problem is that it \"takes a while\" from when an event is "
"dispatched until the profiler's call to get the time actually *gets* the "
"state of the clock.  Similarly, there is a certain lag when exiting the "
"profiler event handler from the time that the clock's value was obtained "
"(and then squirreled away), until the user's code is once again executing.  "
"As a result, functions that are called many times, or call many functions, "
"will typically accumulate this error. The error that accumulates in this "
"fashion is typically less than the accuracy of the clock (less than one "
"clock tick), but it *can* accumulate and become very significant."
msgstr ""
"第二个问题是，从调度事件到分析器调用获取时间函数实际 *获取* 时钟状态，这需要 \"一段时间\" "
"。类似地，从获取时钟值（然后保存）开始，直到再次执行用户代码为止，退出分析器事件句柄时也存在一定的延迟。因此，多次调用单个函数或调用多个函数通常会累积此错误。尽管这种方式的误差通常小于时钟的精度（小于一个时钟周期），但它"
