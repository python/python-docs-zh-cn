"The :mod:`glob` module finds all the pathnames matching a specified pattern "
"according to the rules used by the Unix shell, although results are returned"
" in arbitrary order.  No tilde expansion is done, but ``*``, ``?``, and "
"character ranges expressed with ``[]`` will be correctly matched.  This is "
"done by using the :func:`os.scandir` and :func:`fnmatch.fnmatch` functions "
"in concert, and not by actually invoking a subshell.  Note that unlike "
":func:`fnmatch.fnmatch`, :mod:`glob` treats filenames beginning with a dot "
"(``.``) as special cases. (For tilde and shell variable expansion, use "
":func:`os.path.expanduser` and :func:`os.path.expandvars`.)"

"For a literal match, wrap the meta-characters in brackets. For example, "

"Return a possibly-empty list of path names that match *pathname*, which must"
" be a string containing a path specification. *pathname* can be either "
"absolute (like :file:`/usr/src/Python-1.5/Makefile`) or relative (like "
":file:`../../Tools/\\*/\\*.gif`), and can contain shell-style wildcards. "

"If *recursive* is true, the pattern \"``**``\" will match any files and zero"
" or more directories, subdirectories and symbolic links to directories. If "
"the pattern is followed by an :data:`os.sep` or :data:`os.altsep` then files"
" will not match."

"Escape all special characters (``'?'``, ``'*'`` and ``'['``). This is useful"
" if you want to match an arbitrary literal string that may have special "
"characters in it.  Special characters in drive/UNC sharepoints are not "
"escaped, e.g. on Windows ``escape('//?/c:/Quo vadis?.txt')`` returns "
"``'//?/c:/Quo vadis[?].txt'``."
