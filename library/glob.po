"The :mod:`glob` module finds all the pathnames matching a specified pattern "
"according to the rules used by the Unix shell, although results are returned"
" in arbitrary order.  No tilde expansion is done, but ``*``, ``?``, and "
"character ranges expressed with ``[]`` will be correctly matched.  This is "
"done by using the :func:`os.scandir` and :func:`fnmatch.fnmatch` functions "
"in concert, and not by actually invoking a subshell."

#: ../../library/glob.rst:28
msgid ""
"Note that files beginning with a dot (``.``) can only be matched by patterns"
" that also start with a dot, unlike :func:`fnmatch.fnmatch` or "
":func:`pathlib.Path.glob`. (For tilde and shell variable expansion, use "
":func:`os.path.expanduser` and :func:`os.path.expandvars`.)"

"Return a possibly-empty list of path names that match *pathname*, which must"
" be a string containing a path specification. *pathname* can be either "
"absolute (like :file:`/usr/src/Python-1.5/Makefile`) or relative (like "
":file:`../../Tools/\\*/\\*.gif`), and can contain shell-style wildcards. "
"Broken symlinks are included in the results (as in the shell). Whether or "
"not the results are sorted depends on the file system.  If a file that "
"satisfies conditions is removed or added during the call of this function, "
"whether a path name for that file be included is unspecified."

"If *recursive* is true, the pattern \"``**``\" will match any files and zero"
" or more directories, subdirectories and symbolic links to directories. If "

" will not match."

"Escape all special characters (``'?'``, ``'*'`` and ``'['``). This is useful"
" if you want to match an arbitrary literal string that may have special "

"escaped, e.g. on Windows ``escape('//?/c:/Quo vadis?.txt')`` returns "
"``'//?/c:/Quo vadis[?].txt'``."
