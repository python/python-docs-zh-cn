"The :mod:`glob` module finds all the pathnames matching a specified pattern "
"according to the rules used by the Unix shell, although results are returned"
" in arbitrary order.  No tilde expansion is done, but ``*``, ``?``, and "
"character ranges expressed with ``[]`` will be correctly matched.  This is "
"done by using the :func:`os.scandir` and :func:`fnmatch.fnmatch` functions "
"in concert, and not by actually invoking a subshell.  Note that unlike "
":func:`fnmatch.fnmatch`, :mod:`glob` treats filenames beginning with a dot "
"(``.``) as special cases. (For tilde and shell variable expansion, use "
":func:`os.path.expanduser` and :func:`os.path.expandvars`.)"
