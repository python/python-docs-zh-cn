#: ../../library/doctest.rst:280
msgid ""
"In addition, there are cases when you want tests to be part of a module but "
"not part of the help text, which requires that the tests not be included in "
"the docstring. Doctest looks for a module-level variable called ``__test__``"
" and uses it to locate other tests. If ``M.__test__`` exists, it must be a "
"dict, and each entry maps a (string) name to a function object, class "
"object, or string. Function and class object docstrings found from "
"``M.__test__`` are searched, and strings are treated as if they were "
"docstrings.  In output, a key ``K`` in ``M.__test__`` appears with name "
"``M.__test__.K``."

"For example, place this block of code at the top of :file:`example.py`:"

"The value of ``example.__test__[\"numbers\"]`` will be treated as a "
"docstring and all the tests inside it will be run. It is important to note "
"that the value can be mapped to a function, class object, or module; if so, "
":mod:`!doctest` searches them recursively for docstrings, which are then "
"scanned for tests."

"All hard tab characters are expanded to spaces, using 8-column tab stops. "

"capture the output and compare it to an expected value as part of the test."
"  This handling of tabs in the source was arrived at through trial and "

"By default, each time :mod:`doctest` finds a docstring to test, it uses a "
"*shallow copy* of :mod:`!M`'s globals, so that running tests doesn't change "
"the module's real globals, and so that one test in :mod:`!M` can't leave "
"behind crumbs that accidentally allow another test to work.  This means "

"Doctest can't guess whether your expected output came from an exception "
