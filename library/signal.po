"The :func:`signal.signal` function allows defining custom handlers to be "
"executed when a signal is received.  A small number of default handlers are "
"installed: :const:`SIGPIPE` is ignored (so write errors on pipes and sockets"
" can be reported as ordinary Python exceptions) and :const:`SIGINT` is "
"translated into a :exc:`KeyboardInterrupt` exception."

"A handler for a particular signal, once set, remains installed until it is "

"A Python signal handler does not get executed inside the low-level (C) "
"signal handler.  Instead, the low-level signal handler sets a flag which "
"tells the :term:`virtual machine` to execute the corresponding Python signal"
" handler at a later point(for example at the next :term:`bytecode` "
"instruction). This has consequences:"

"It makes little sense to catch synchronous errors like :const:`SIGFPE` or "
":const:`SIGSEGV` that are caused by an invalid operation in C code.  Python "
"will return from the signal handler to the C code, which is likely to raise "
"the same signal again, causing Python to apparently hang.  From Python 3.3 "
"onwards, you can use the :mod:`faulthandler` module to report on synchronous"
