"The :func:`signal.signal` function allows defining custom handlers to be "
"executed when a signal is received.  A small number of default handlers are "
"installed: :const:`SIGPIPE` is ignored (so write errors on pipes and sockets"

"translated into a :exc:`KeyboardInterrupt` exception."

"A Python signal handler does not get executed inside the low-level (C) "

"It makes little sense to catch synchronous errors like :const:`SIGFPE` or "

"will return from the signal handler to the C code, which is likely to raise "
