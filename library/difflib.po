"This module provides classes and functions for comparing sequences. It can "

"This is a flexible class for comparing pairs of sequences of any type, so "
"long as the sequence elements are :term:`hashable`.  The basic algorithm "
"predates, and is a little fancier than, an algorithm published in the late "
"1980's by Ratcliff and Obershelp under the hyperbolic name \"gestalt pattern"
" matching.\"  The idea is to find the longest contiguous matching "
"subsequence that contains no \"junk\" elements; these \"junk\" elements are "
"ones that are uninteresting in some sense, such as blank lines or "
"whitespace.  (Handling junk is an extension to the Ratcliff and Obershelp "
"algorithm.) The same idea is then applied recursively to the pieces of the "
"sequences to the left and to the right of the matching subsequence.  This "
"does not yield minimal edit sequences, but does tend to yield matches that "
"\"look right\" to people."

"**Automatic junk heuristic:** :class:`SequenceMatcher` supports a heuristic "

"item's duplicates (after the first one) account for more than 1% of the "
"sequence and the sequence is at least 200 items long, this item is marked as"
" \"popular\" and is treated as junk for the purpose of sequence matching. "
