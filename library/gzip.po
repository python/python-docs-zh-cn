"The :mod:`gzip` module provides the :class:`GzipFile` class, as well as the "
":func:`.open`, :func:`compress` and :func:`decompress` convenience "
"functions. The :class:`GzipFile` class reads and writes :program:`gzip`\\ "
"-format files, automatically compressing or decompressing the data so that "
"it looks like an ordinary :term:`file object`."
