msgid ""
"This module provides access to operating system functionality that is "
"standardized by the C Standard and the POSIX standard (a thinly disguised "
"Unix interface)."

"**Do not import this module directly.**  Instead, import the module "
":mod:`os`, which provides a *portable* version of this interface.  On Unix, "
"the :mod:`os` module provides a superset of the :mod:`posix` interface.  On "
"non-Unix operating systems the :mod:`posix` module is not available, but a "
"subset is always available through the :mod:`os` interface.  Once :mod:`os` "
"is imported, there is *no* performance penalty in using it instead of "
":mod:`posix`.  In addition, :mod:`os` provides some additional "
"functionality, such as automatically calling :func:`~os.putenv` when an "
"entry in ``os.environ`` is changed."

msgid "Large File Support"
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/posix.rst:40
msgid ""
"Several operating systems (including AIX, HP-UX, Irix and Solaris) provide "
"support for files that are larger than 2 GiB from a C programming model "
"where :c:type:`int` and :c:type:`long` are 32-bit values. This is typically "
"accomplished by defining the relevant size and offset types as 64-bit "
"values. Such files are sometimes referred to as :dfn:`large files`."
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/posix.rst:46
msgid ""
"Large file support is enabled in Python when the size of an :c:type:`off_t` "
"is larger than a :c:type:`long` and the :c:type:`long long` is at least as "
"large as an :c:type:`off_t`. It may be necessary to configure and compile "
"Python with certain compiler flags to enable this mode. For example, it is "
"enabled by default with recent versions of Irix, but with Solaris 2.6 and "
"2.7 you need to do something like::"

msgid ""
"In addition to many functions described in the :mod:`os` module "
"documentation, :mod:`posix` defines the following data item:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/posix.rst:72
msgid ""
"A dictionary representing the string environment at the time the interpreter"
" was started. Keys and values are bytes on Unix and str on Windows. For "
"example, ``environ[b'HOME']`` (``environ['HOME']`` on Windows) is the "
"pathname of your home directory, equivalent to ``getenv(\"HOME\")`` in C."
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/posix.rst:77
msgid ""
"Modifying this dictionary does not affect the string environment passed on "
"by :func:`~os.execv`, :func:`~os.popen` or :func:`~os.system`; if you need "
"to change the environment, pass ``environ`` to :func:`~os.execve` or add "
"variable assignments and export statements to the command string for "
":func:`~os.system` or :func:`~os.popen`."
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/posix.rst:83
msgid "On Unix, keys and values are bytes."
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/posix.rst:88
msgid ""
"The :mod:`os` module provides an alternate implementation of ``environ`` "
"which updates the environment on modification. Note also that updating "
":data:`os.environ` will render this dictionary obsolete. Use of the "
":mod:`os` module version of this is recommended over direct access to the "
":mod:`posix` module."
