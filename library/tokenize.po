"The :mod:`tokenize` module provides a lexical scanner for Python source "
"code, implemented in Python.  The scanner in this module returns comments as"
" tokens as well, making it useful for implementing \"pretty-printers\", "

"To simplify token stream handling, all :ref:`operator <operators>` and "
":ref:`delimiter <delimiters>` tokens and :data:`Ellipsis` are returned using"
" the generic :data:`~token.OP` token type.  The exact type can be determined"
" by checking the ``exact_type`` property on the :term:`named tuple` returned"
" from :func:`tokenize.tokenize`."
