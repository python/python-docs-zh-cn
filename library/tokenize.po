"The :mod:`tokenize` module provides a lexical scanner for Python source "
"code, implemented in Python.  The scanner in this module returns comments as"
" tokens as well, making it useful for implementing \"pretty-printers\", "
"including colorizers for on-screen displays."
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/tokenize.rst:19
msgid ""
"To simplify token stream handling, all :ref:`operator <operators>` and "
":ref:`delimiter <delimiters>` tokens and :data:`Ellipsis` are returned using"
" the generic :data:`~token.OP` token type.  The exact type can be determined"
" by checking the ``exact_type`` property on the :term:`named tuple` returned"
" from :func:`tokenize.tokenize`."
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/tokenize.rst:28
msgid ""
"Note that the functions in this module are only designed to parse "
"syntactically valid Python code (code that does not raise when parsed using "
":func:`ast.parse`).  The behavior of the functions in this module is "
"**undefined** when providing invalid Python code and it can change at any "
"point."

"The :func:`.tokenize` generator requires one argument, *readline*, which "
"must be a callable object which provides the same interface as the "
":meth:`io.IOBase.readline` method of file objects.  Each call to the "
"function should return one line of input as bytes."

"The generator produces 5-tuples with these members: the token type; the "
"token string; a 2-tuple ``(srow, scol)`` of ints specifying the row and "
"column where the token begins in the source; a 2-tuple ``(erow, ecol)`` of "
"ints specifying the row and column where the token ends in the source; and "
"the line on which the token was found. The line passed (the last tuple item)"
" is the *physical* line.  The 5 tuple is returned as a :term:`named tuple` "
"with the field names: ``type string start end line``."

"The returned :term:`named tuple` has an additional property named "
