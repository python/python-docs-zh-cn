"A pull parser suitable for non-blocking applications.  Its input-side API is"
" similar to that of :class:`XMLParser`, but instead of pushing calls to a "
"callback target, :class:`XMLPullParser` collects an internal list of parsing"
" events and lets the user read from it. *events* is a sequence of events to "
"report back.  The supported events are the strings ``\"start\"``, "
"``\"end\"``, ``\"comment\"``, ``\"pi\"``, ``\"start-ns\"`` and ``\"end-"
"ns\"`` (the \"ns\" events are used to get detailed namespace information).  "
