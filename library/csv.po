"The so-called CSV (Comma Separated Values) format is the most common import "
"and export format for spreadsheets and databases.  CSV format was used for "
"many years prior to attempts to describe the format in a standardized way in"
" :rfc:`4180`.  The lack of a well-defined standard means that subtle "
"differences often exist in the data produced and consumed by different "
"applications.  These differences can make it annoying to process CSV files "
"from multiple sources. Still, while the delimiters and quoting characters "
"vary, the overall format is similar enough that it is possible to write a "
"single module which can efficiently manipulate such data, hiding the details"
" of reading and writing the data from the programmer."
