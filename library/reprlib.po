"The :mod:`!reprlib` module provides a means for producing object "

"Class which provides formatting services useful in implementing functions "
"similar to the built-in :func:`repr`; size limits for  different object "

"This is an instance of :class:`Repr` which is used to provide the "
":func:`.repr` function described below.  Changing the attributes of this "

"debugger."

#: ../../library/reprlib.rst:37

"This is the :meth:`~Repr.repr` method of ``aRepr``.  It returns a string "

"Decorator for :meth:`~object.__repr__` methods to detect recursive calls "
