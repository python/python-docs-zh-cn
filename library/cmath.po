"This module provides access to mathematical functions for complex numbers.  "
"The functions in this module accept integers, floating-point numbers or "
"complex numbers as arguments. They will also accept any Python object that "
"has either a :meth:`~object.__complex__` or a :meth:`~object.__float__` "
"method: these methods are used to convert the object to a complex or "
"floating-point number, respectively, and the function is then applied to the"
" result of the conversion."

"For functions involving branch cuts, we have the problem of deciding how to "
"define those functions on the cut itself. Following Kahan's \"Branch cuts "
"for complex elementary functions\" paper, as well as Annex G of C99 and "
"later C standards, we use the sign of zero to distinguish one side of the "
"branch cut from the other: for a branch cut along (a portion of) the real "
"axis we look at the sign of the imaginary part, while for a branch cut along"
" the imaginary axis we look at the sign of the real part."
