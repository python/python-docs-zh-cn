"This module is always available.  It provides access to mathematical "
"functions for complex numbers.  The functions in this module accept "
"integers, floating-point numbers or complex numbers as arguments. They will "
"also accept any Python object that has either a :meth:`__complex__` or a "
":meth:`__float__` method: these methods are used to convert the object to a "
"complex or floating-point number, respectively, and the function is then "
"applied to the result of the conversion."
