"This module provides access to mathematical functions for complex numbers.  "
"The functions in this module accept integers, floating-point numbers or "
"complex numbers as arguments. They will also accept any Python object that "
"has either a :meth:`__complex__` or a :meth:`__float__` method: these "
"methods are used to convert the object to a complex or floating-point "
"number, respectively, and the function is then applied to the result of the "
"conversion."

"functions involving branch cuts are continuous on *both* sides of the branch"
" cut: the sign of the zero distinguishes one side of the branch cut from the"
