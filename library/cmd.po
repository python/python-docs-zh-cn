"The :class:`Cmd` class provides a simple framework for writing line-oriented"
" command interpreters.  These are often useful for test harnesses, "

"A :class:`Cmd` instance or subclass instance is a line-oriented interpreter "
"framework.  There is no good reason to instantiate :class:`Cmd` itself; "
"rather, it's useful as a superclass of an interpreter class you define "
"yourself in order to inherit :class:`Cmd`'s methods and encapsulate action "
"methods."
