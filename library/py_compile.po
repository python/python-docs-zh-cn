"The :mod:`py_compile` module provides a function to generate a byte-code "
"file from a source file, and another function used when the module source "
"file is invoked as a script."
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/py_compile.rst:20
msgid ""
"Though not often needed, this function can be useful when installing modules"
" for shared use, especially if some of the users may not have permission to "
"write the byte-code cache files in the directory containing the source code."

"Compile a source file to byte-code and write out the byte-code cache file. "
"The source code is loaded from the file named *file*.  The byte-code is "
"written to *cfile*, which defaults to the :pep:`3147`/:pep:`488` path, "
"ending in ``.pyc``. For example, if *file* is ``/foo/bar/baz.py`` *cfile* "
"will default to ``/foo/bar/__pycache__/baz.cpython-32.pyc`` for Python 3.2."
"  If *dfile* is specified, it is used instead of *file* as the name of the "
"source file from which source lines are obtained for display in exception "
"tracebacks. If *doraise* is true, a :exc:`PyCompileError` is raised when an "
"error is encountered while compiling *file*. If *doraise* is false (the "
"default), an error string is written to ``sys.stderr``, but no exception is "
"raised.  This function returns the path to byte-compiled file, i.e. whatever"
" *cfile* value was used."
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/py_compile.rst:46
msgid ""
"The *doraise* and *quiet* arguments determine how errors are handled while "
"compiling file. If *quiet* is 0 or 1, and *doraise* is false, the default "
"behaviour is enabled: an error string is written to ``sys.stderr``, and the "
"function returns ``None`` instead of a path. If *doraise* is true, a "
":exc:`PyCompileError` is raised instead. However if *quiet* is 2, no message"
" is written, and *doraise* has no effect."
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/py_compile.rst:53
msgid ""
"If the path that *cfile* becomes (either explicitly specified or computed) "
"is a symlink or non-regular file, :exc:`FileExistsError` will be raised. "
"This is to act as a warning that import will turn those paths into regular "
"files if it is allowed to write byte-compiled files to those paths. This is "
"a side-effect of import using file renaming to place the final byte-compiled"
" file into place to prevent concurrent file writing issues."

"*optimize* controls the optimization level and is passed to the built-in "
":func:`compile` function.  The default of ``-1`` selects the optimization "

msgstr ""

#: ../../library/py_compile.rst:64
msgid ""
"*invalidation_mode* should be a member of the :class:`PycInvalidationMode` "
"enum and controls how the generated bytecode cache is invalidated at "
"runtime.  The default is :attr:`PycInvalidationMode.CHECKED_HASH` if the "
":envvar:`SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` environment variable is set, otherwise the "
"default is :attr:`PycInvalidationMode.TIMESTAMP`."
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/py_compile.rst:70
msgid ""
"Changed default value of *cfile* to be :PEP:`3147`-compliant.  Previous "
"default was *file* + ``'c'`` (``'o'`` if optimization was enabled). Also "
"added the *optimize* parameter."
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/py_compile.rst:75
msgid ""
"Changed code to use :mod:`importlib` for the byte-code cache file writing. "
"This means file creation/writing semantics now match what :mod:`importlib` "
"does, e.g. permissions, write-and-move semantics, etc. Also added the caveat"
" that :exc:`FileExistsError` is raised if *cfile* is a symlink or non-"
"regular file."

"The *invalidation_mode* parameter was added as specified in :pep:`552`. If "

"Like :attr:`CHECKED_HASH`, the ``.pyc`` file includes a hash of the source "
