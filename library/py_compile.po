"The :mod:`py_compile` module provides a function to generate a byte-code "

"Though not often needed, this function can be useful when installing modules"
" for shared use, especially if some of the users may not have permission to "
"write the byte-code cache files in the directory containing the source code."

"Compile a source file to byte-code and write out the byte-code cache file. "
"The source code is loaded from the file named *file*.  The byte-code is "
"written to *cfile*, which defaults to the :pep:`3147`/:pep:`488` path, "
"ending in ``.pyc``. For example, if *file* is ``/foo/bar/baz.py`` *cfile* "
"will default to ``/foo/bar/__pycache__/baz.cpython-32.pyc`` for Python 3.2."
"  If *dfile* is specified, it is used as the name of the source file in "
"error messages when instead of *file*.  If *doraise* is true, a "
":exc:`PyCompileError` is raised when an error is encountered while compiling"
" *file*. If *doraise* is false (the default), an error string is written to "
"``sys.stderr``, but no exception is raised.  This function returns the path "
"to byte-compiled file, i.e. whatever *cfile* value was used."

#: ../../library/py_compile.rst:45
msgid ""
"If the path that *cfile* becomes (either explicitly specified or computed) "
"is a symlink or non-regular file, :exc:`FileExistsError` will be raised. "
"This is to act as a warning that import will turn those paths into regular "
"files if it is allowed to write byte-compiled files to those paths. This is "
"a side-effect of import using file renaming to place the final byte-compiled"
" file into place to prevent concurrent file writing issues."

"*optimize* controls the optimization level and is passed to the built-in "

"*invalidation_mode* should be a member of the :class:`PycInvalidationMode` "

":envvar:`SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` environment variable is set, otherwise the "
"default is :attr:`PycInvalidationMode.TIMESTAMP`."

"Changed default value of *cfile* to be :PEP:`3147`-compliant.  Previous "
"default was *file* + ``'c'`` (``'o'`` if optimization was enabled). Also "
"added the *optimize* parameter."
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/py_compile.rst:67
msgid ""
"Changed code to use :mod:`importlib` for the byte-code cache file writing. "
"This means file creation/writing semantics now match what :mod:`importlib` "
"does, e.g. permissions, write-and-move semantics, etc. Also added the caveat"
" that :exc:`FileExistsError` is raised if *cfile* is a symlink or non-"
"regular file."
