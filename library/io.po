"The :mod:`io` module provides Python's main facilities for dealing with "
"various types of I/O.  There are three main types of I/O: *text I/O*, "
"*binary I/O* and *raw I/O*.  These are generic categories, and various "
"backing stores can be used for each of them.  A concrete object belonging to"
" any of these categories is called a :term:`file object`.  Other common "
"terms are *stream* and *file-like object*."
msgstr ""
":mod:`io` 模块提供了 Python 用于处理各种 I/O 类型的主要工具。三种主要的 I/O类型分别为: *文本 I/O*, *二进制 "
"I/O* 和 *原始 I/O*。这些是泛型类型，有很多种后端存储可以用在他们上面。一个隶属于任何这些类型的具体对象被称作 :term:`file "
"object`。 其他同类的术语还有 *流* 和 *类文件对象*。"

"Independent of its category, each concrete stream object will also have "
"various capabilities: it can be read-only, write-only, or read-write. It can"
