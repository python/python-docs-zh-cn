"The :mod:`io` module provides Python's main facilities for dealing with "

"*binary I/O* and *raw I/O*.  These are generic categories, and various "
"backing stores can be used for each of them.  A concrete object belonging to"
" any of these categories is called a :term:`file object`.  Other common "
"terms are *stream* and *file-like object*."

"Independent of its category, each concrete stream object will also have "

"such as Linux, unbuffered disk I/O can be as fast as buffered I/O.  The "
"bottom line, however, is that buffered I/O offers predictable performance "
"regardless of the platform and the backing device.  Therefore, it is almost "
