"The :mod:`xml.sax` package provides a number of modules which implement the "
"Simple API for XML (SAX) interface for Python.  The package itself provides "

"users of the SAX API."

":mod:`xml.sax` 包提供多个模块，它们在 Python 上实现了用于 XML (SAX)  接口的简单 API。 这个包本身为  SAX "

"The SAX parser no longer processes general external entities by default to "
"increase security. Before, the parser created network connections to fetch "
"remote files or loaded local files from the file system for DTD and "
"entities. The feature can be enabled again with method "
":meth:`~xml.sax.xmlreader.XMLReader.setFeature` on the parser object and "
"argument :data:`~xml.sax.handler.feature_external_ges`."
msgstr ""
"SAX 解析器默认不会再处理通用外部实体以便提升安全性。 在此之前，解析器会创建网络连接来获取远程文件或是从 DTD 和实体文件系统中加载本地文件。 "

"A typical SAX application uses three kinds of objects: readers, handlers and"
" input sources.  \"Reader\" in this context is another term for parser, i.e."
" some piece of code that reads the bytes or characters from the input "
"source, and produces a sequence of events. The events then get distributed "
"to the handler objects, i.e. the reader invokes a method on the handler.  A "
"SAX application must therefore obtain a reader object, create or open the "
"input sources, create the handlers, and connect these objects all together."
"  As the final step of preparation, the reader is called to parse the input."
" During parsing, methods on the handler objects are called based on "
"structural and syntactic events from the input data."
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/xml.sax.rst:82
msgid ""
"For these objects, only the interfaces are relevant; they are normally not "
"instantiated by the application itself.  Since Python does not have an "
"explicit notion of interface, they are formally introduced as classes, but "
"applications may use implementations which do not inherit from the provided "
"classes.  The :class:`~xml.sax.xmlreader.InputSource`, "
":class:`~xml.sax.xmlreader.Locator`, :class:`~xml.sax.xmlreader.Attributes`,"
" :class:`~xml.sax.xmlreader.AttributesNS`, and "

":mod:`xml.sax.xmlreader`.  The handler interfaces are defined in "
":mod:`xml.sax.handler`.  For convenience, "
":class:`~xml.sax.xmlreader.InputSource` (which is often instantiated "
"directly) and the handler classes are also available from :mod:`xml.sax`.  "
