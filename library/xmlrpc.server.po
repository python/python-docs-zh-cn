"Create a new server instance.  This class provides methods for registration "

"and *requestHandler* parameters are passed to the "
":class:`socketserver.TCPServer` constructor.  If *logRequests* is true (the "
"default), requests will be logged; setting this parameter to false will turn"
" off logging.   The *allow_none* and *encoding* parameters are passed on to "
":mod:`xmlrpc.client` and control the XML-RPC responses that will be returned"
" from the server. The *bind_and_activate* parameter controls whether "
":meth:`server_bind` and :meth:`server_activate` are called immediately by "
"the constructor; it defaults to true. Setting it to false allows code to "
"manipulate the *allow_reuse_address* class variable before the address is "
