"The :mod:`filecmp` module defines functions to compare files and "

"Compare the files named *f1* and *f2*, returning ``True`` if they seem "
"equal, ``False`` otherwise."

"If *shallow* is true and the :func:`os.stat` signatures (file type, size, "
"and modification time) of both files are identical, the files are taken to "
"be equal."

"Otherwise, the files are treated as different if their sizes or contents "

"Returns three lists of file names: *match*, *mismatch*, *errors*.  *match* "
"contains the list of files that match, *mismatch* contains the names of "
"those that don't, and *errors* lists the names of files which could not be "
"compared.  Files are listed in *errors* if they don't exist in one of the "
"directories, the user lacks permission to read them or if the comparison "
"could not be done for some other reason."

"For example, ``cmpfiles('a', 'b', ['c', 'd/e'])`` will compare ``a/c`` with "
