"The :mod:`http.cookies` module defines classes for abstracting the concept "
"of cookies, an HTTP state management mechanism. It supports both simple "
"string-only cookies, and provides an abstraction for having any serializable"
" data-type as cookie value."

"The module formerly strictly applied the parsing rules described in the "
":rfc:`2109` and :rfc:`2068` specifications.  It has since been discovered "
"that MSIE 3.0x doesn't follow the character rules outlined in those specs "
"and also many current day browsers and servers have relaxed parsing rules "
"when comes to Cookie handling.  As a result, the parsing rules used are a "
"bit less strict."
