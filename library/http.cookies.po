"The :mod:`http.cookies` module defines classes for abstracting the concept "
"of cookies, an HTTP state management mechanism. It supports both simple "
"string-only cookies, and provides an abstraction for having any serializable"
" data-type as cookie value."

"The module formerly strictly applied the parsing rules described in the "
":rfc:`2109` and :rfc:`2068` specifications.  It has since been discovered "
"that MSIE 3.0x didn't follow the character rules outlined in those specs; "
"many current-day browsers and servers have also relaxed parsing rules when "
"it comes to cookie handling.  As a result, this module now uses parsing "
"rules that are a bit less strict than they once were."
