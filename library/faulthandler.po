msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This module contains functions to dump Python tracebacks explicitly, on a "
"fault, after a timeout, or on a user signal. Call "
":func:`faulthandler.enable` to install fault handlers for the "
":const:`SIGSEGV`, :const:`SIGFPE`, :const:`SIGABRT`, :const:`SIGBUS`, and "
":const:`SIGILL` signals. You can also enable them at startup by setting the "
":envvar:`PYTHONFAULTHANDLER` environment variable or by using the "
":option:`-X` ``faulthandler`` command line option."

msgid ""
"The fault handler is compatible with system fault handlers like Apport or "
"the Windows fault handler. The module uses an alternative stack for signal "
"handlers if the :c:func:`sigaltstack` function is available. This allows it "
"to dump the traceback even on a stack overflow."

"The fault handler is called on catastrophic cases and therefore can only use"
" signal-safe functions (e.g. it cannot allocate memory on the heap). Because"
" of this limitation traceback dumping is minimal compared to normal Python "
"tracebacks:"
