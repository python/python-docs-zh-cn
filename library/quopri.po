"This module performs quoted-printable transport encoding and decoding, as "
"defined in :rfc:`1521`: \"MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) Part "
"One: Mechanisms for Specifying and Describing the Format of Internet Message"
" Bodies\". The quoted-printable encoding is designed for data where there "
"are relatively few nonprintable characters; the base64 encoding scheme "
"available via the :mod:`base64` module is more compact if there are many "
"such characters, as when sending a graphics file."

"and true, underscore will be decoded as space. This is used to decode "
