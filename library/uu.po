"This module encodes and decodes files in uuencode format, allowing arbitrary"
" binary data to be transferred over ASCII-only connections. Wherever a file "
"argument is expected, the methods accept a file-like object.  For backwards "
"compatibility, a string containing a pathname is also accepted, and the "
"corresponding file will be opened for reading and writing; the pathname "
"``'-'`` is understood to mean the standard input or output.  However, this "
"interface is deprecated; it's better for the caller to open the file itself,"
" and be sure that, when required, the mode is ``'rb'`` or ``'wb'`` on "
"Windows."

"Uuencode file *in_file* into file *out_file*.  The uuencoded file will have "

"decoding the file. The default defaults are taken from *in_file*, or ``'-'``"
" and ``0o666`` respectively.  If *backtick* is true, zeros are represented "

"This call decodes uuencoded file *in_file* placing the result on file "
"*out_file*. If *out_file* is a pathname, *mode* is used to set the "

"*mode* are taken from the uuencode header.  However, if the file specified "
