"Memory-mapped file objects behave like both :class:`bytearray` and like "
":term:`file objects <file object>`.  You can use mmap objects in most places"
" where :class:`bytearray` are expected; for example, you can use the "
":mod:`re` module to search through a memory-mapped file.  You can also "
"change a single byte by doing ``obj[index] = 97``, or change a subsequence "
"by assigning to a slice: ``obj[i1:i2] = b'...'``.  You can also read and "
"write data starting at the current file position, and :meth:`seek` through "
"the file to different positions."

"A memory-mapped file is created by the :class:`~mmap.mmap` constructor, "
"which is different on Unix and on Windows.  In either case you must provide "
"a file descriptor for a file opened for update. If you wish to map an "
"existing Python file object, use its :meth:`fileno` method to obtain the "
"correct value for the *fileno* parameter.  Otherwise, you can open the file "
"using the :func:`os.open` function, which returns a file descriptor directly"
" (the file still needs to be closed when done)."

"If you want to create a memory-mapping for a writable, buffered file, you "
"should :func:`~io.IOBase.flush` the file first.  This is necessary to ensure"
" that local modifications to the buffers are actually available to the "
"mapping."

#: ../../library/mmap.rst:31
msgid ""
"For both the Unix and Windows versions of the constructor, *access* may be "
"specified as an optional keyword parameter. *access* accepts one of three "
"values: :const:`ACCESS_READ`, :const:`ACCESS_WRITE`, or :const:`ACCESS_COPY`"
" to specify read-only, write-through or copy-on-write memory respectively. "
"*access* can be used on both Unix and Windows.  If *access* is not "
"specified, Windows mmap returns a write-through mapping.  The initial memory"
" values for all three access types are taken from the specified file.  "
"Assignment to an :const:`ACCESS_READ` memory map raises a :exc:`TypeError` "
"exception. Assignment to an :const:`ACCESS_WRITE` memory map affects both "
"memory and the underlying file.  Assignment to an :const:`ACCESS_COPY` "
"memory map affects memory but does not update the underlying file."

"size of the file, except that if the file is empty Windows raises an "
"exception (you cannot create an empty mapping on Windows)."

"*tagname*, if specified and not ``None``, is a string giving a tag name for "
"the mapping.  Windows allows you to have many different mappings against the"
" same file.  If you specify the name of an existing tag, that tag is opened,"
" otherwise a new tag of this name is created.  If this parameter is omitted "
"or ``None``, the mapping is created without a name.  Avoiding the use of the"
