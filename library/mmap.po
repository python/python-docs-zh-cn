"Memory-mapped file objects behave like both :class:`bytearray` and like "
":term:`file objects <file object>`.  You can use mmap objects in most places"
" where :class:`bytearray` are expected; for example, you can use the "
":mod:`re` module to search through a memory-mapped file.  You can also "
"change a single byte by doing ``obj[index] = 97``, or change a subsequence "
"by assigning to a slice: ``obj[i1:i2] = b'...'``.  You can also read and "
"write data starting at the current file position, and :meth:`seek` through "
"the file to different positions."
msgstr ""
"内存映射（mmap）文件对象的行为既像 :class:`bytearray` 又像 :term:`文件对象 <file object>`。 "
"你可以在大部分接受 :class:`bytearray` 的地方使用 mmap 对象；例如，你可以使用 :mod:`re` 模块来搜索一个内存映射文件。"
" 你也可以通过执行 ``obj[index] = 97`` 来修改单个字节，或者通过对切片赋值来修改一个子序列: ``obj[i1:i2] = "
"b'...'``。 你还可以在文件的当前位置开始读取和写入数据，并使用 :meth:`seek` 前往另一个位置。"

msgid ""
"A memory-mapped file is created by the :class:`~mmap.mmap` constructor, "
"which is different on Unix and on Windows.  In either case you must provide "
"a file descriptor for a file opened for update. If you wish to map an "
"existing Python file object, use its :meth:`fileno` method to obtain the "
"correct value for the *fileno* parameter.  Otherwise, you can open the file "
"using the :func:`os.open` function, which returns a file descriptor directly"
" (the file still needs to be closed when done)."
msgstr ""
"内存映射文件是由 :class:`~mmap.mmap` 构造函数创建的，其在 Unix和 Windows上是不同的。 "
"无论哪种情况，你都必须为一个打开的文件提供文件描述符以进行更新。 如果你希望映射一个已有的 Python 文件对象，请使用该对象的 "
":meth:`fileno` 方法来获取 *fileno* 参数的正确值。 否则，你可以使用 :func:`os.open` "
"函数来打开这个文件，这会直接返回一个文件描述符（结束时仍然需要关闭该文件）。"

"If you want to create a memory-mapping for a writable, buffered file, you "

"For both the Unix and Windows versions of the constructor, *access* may be "

"values: :const:`ACCESS_READ`, :const:`ACCESS_WRITE`, or :const:`ACCESS_COPY`"
" to specify read-only, write-through or copy-on-write memory respectively, "
"or :const:`ACCESS_DEFAULT` to defer to *prot*.  *access* can be used on both"
" Unix and Windows.  If *access* is not specified, Windows mmap returns a "
"write-through mapping.  The initial memory values for all three access types"
" are taken from the specified file.  Assignment to an :const:`ACCESS_READ` "
"memory map raises a :exc:`TypeError` exception.  Assignment to an "
":const:`ACCESS_WRITE` memory map affects both memory and the underlying "
"file. Assignment to an :const:`ACCESS_COPY` memory map affects memory but "
