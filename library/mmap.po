"Memory-mapped file objects behave like both :class:`bytearray` and like "
":term:`file objects <file object>`.  You can use mmap objects in most places"
" where :class:`bytearray` are expected; for example, you can use the "
":mod:`re` module to search through a memory-mapped file.  You can also "
"change a single byte by doing ``obj[index] = 97``, or change a subsequence "
"by assigning to a slice: ``obj[i1:i2] = b'...'``.  You can also read and "
"write data starting at the current file position, and :meth:`seek` through "
"the file to different positions."
msgstr ""
"内存映射文件对象的行为既像 :class:`bytearray` 又像 :term:`文件对象 <file object>`。 你可以在大部分接受 "
":class:`bytearray` 的地方使用 mmap 对象；例如，你可以使用 :mod:`re` 模块来搜索一个内存映射文件。 你也可以通过执行 "
"``obj[index] = 97`` 来修改单个字节，或者通过对切片赋值来修改一个子序列: ``obj[i1:i2] = b'...'``。 "
"你还可以在文件的当前位置开始读取和写入数据，并使用 :meth:`seek` 前往另一个位置。"

"A memory-mapped file is created by the :class:`~mmap.mmap` constructor, "
"which is different on Unix and on Windows.  In either case you must provide "
"a file descriptor for a file opened for update. If you wish to map an "
"existing Python file object, use its :meth:`fileno` method to obtain the "
"correct value for the *fileno* parameter.  Otherwise, you can open the file "
"using the :func:`os.open` function, which returns a file descriptor directly"
" (the file still needs to be closed when done)."
msgstr ""
"内存映射文件是由 :class:`~mmap.mmap` 构造函数创建的，其在 Unix 和 Windows 上是不同的。 "

" are taken from the specified file.  Assignment to an :const:`ACCESS_READ` "
