"A :class:`~netrc.netrc` instance or subclass instance encapsulates data from"

"home directory -- as determined by :func:`os.path.expanduser` -- will be "
"read.  Otherwise, a :exc:`FileNotFoundError` exception will be raised. Parse"
" errors will raise :exc:`NetrcParseError` with diagnostic information "
"including the file name, line number, and terminating token. If no argument "
"is specified on a POSIX system, the presence of passwords in the "
":file:`.netrc` file will raise a :exc:`NetrcParseError` if the file "
"ownership or permissions are insecure (owned by a user other than the user "
"running the process, or accessible for read or write by any other user). "
