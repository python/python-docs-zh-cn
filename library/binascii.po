"The :mod:`binascii` module contains a number of methods to convert between "
"binary and various ASCII-encoded binary representations. Normally, you will "
"not use these functions directly but use wrapper modules like :mod:`uu` or "
":mod:`base64` instead. The :mod:`binascii` module contains low-level "
"functions written in C for greater speed that are used by the higher-level "
"modules."

"``a2b_*`` functions accept Unicode strings containing only ASCII characters."
