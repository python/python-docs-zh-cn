msgid ""
"The :mod:`binascii` module contains a number of methods to convert between "
"binary and various ASCII-encoded binary representations. Normally, you will "
"not use these functions directly but use wrapper modules like :mod:`uu`, "
":mod:`base64`, or :mod:`binhex` instead. The :mod:`binascii` module contains"
" low-level functions written in C for greater speed that are used by the "
"higher-level modules."

"Convert a single line of uuencoded data back to binary and return the binary"
