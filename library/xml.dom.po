"The Document Object Model, or \"DOM,\" is a cross-language API from the "
"World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) for accessing and modifying XML documents.  "
"A DOM implementation presents an XML document as a tree structure, or allows"
" client code to build such a structure from scratch.  It then gives access "
"to the structure through a set of objects which provided well-known "
"interfaces."

"文档对象模型“DOM”是一个来自万维网联盟（W3C）的跨语言 API，用于访问和修改 XML 文档。 DOM 的实现将 XML "
"文档以树结构表示，或者允许客户端代码从头构建这样的结构。 然后它会通过一组提供通用接口的对象赋予对结构的访问权。"

"The DOM is extremely useful for random-access applications.  SAX only allows"
" you a view of one bit of the document at a time.  If you are looking at one"
" SAX element, you have no access to another.  If you are looking at a text "
"node, you have no access to a containing element. When you write a SAX "
"application, you need to keep track of your program's position in the "
"document somewhere in your own code.  SAX does not do it for you.  Also, if "
"you need to look ahead in the XML document, you are just out of luck."
msgstr ""
"DOM 特别适用于进行随机访问的应用。 SAX 仅允许你每次查看文档的一小部分。 如果你正在查看一个 SAX 元素，你将不能访问其他元素。 "
"如果你正在查看一个文本节点，你将不能访问包含它的元素。 当你编写一个 SAX 应用时，你需要在你自己的代码的某个地方记住你的程序在文档中的位置。 SAX"

"way to access an XML reader/parser/Document builder in an implementation-"
"independent way. There is also no well-defined way to access these methods "
"without an existing :class:`Document` object.  In Python, each DOM "
