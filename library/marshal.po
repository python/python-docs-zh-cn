msgid ":mod:`marshal` --- Internal Python object serialization"

msgid ""
"This module contains functions that can read and write Python values in a "
"binary format.  The format is specific to Python, but independent of machine"
" architecture issues (e.g., you can write a Python value to a file on a PC, "
"transport the file to a Sun, and read it back there).  Details of the format"
" are undocumented on purpose; it may change between Python versions "
"(although it rarely does). [#]_"

"This is not a general \"persistence\" module.  For general persistence and "
"transfer of Python objects through RPC calls, see the modules :mod:`pickle` "
"and :mod:`shelve`.  The :mod:`marshal` module exists mainly to support "
"reading and writing the \"pseudo-compiled\" code for Python modules of "
":file:`.pyc` files. Therefore, the Python maintainers reserve the right to "
"modify the marshal format in backward incompatible ways should the need "
"arise.  If you're serializing and de-serializing Python objects, use the "
":mod:`pickle` module instead -- the performance is comparable, version "
"independence is guaranteed, and pickle supports a substantially wider range "
"of objects than marshal."

"The :mod:`marshal` module is not intended to be secure against erroneous or "
"maliciously constructed data.  Never unmarshal data received from an "

"Not all Python object types are supported; in general, only objects whose "
"value is independent from a particular invocation of Python can be written "
"and read by this module.  The following types are supported: booleans, "
"integers, floating point numbers, complex numbers, strings, bytes, "
"bytearrays, tuples, lists, sets, frozensets, dictionaries, and code objects,"
" where it should be understood that tuples, lists, sets, frozensets and "
"dictionaries are only supported as long as the values contained therein are "
"themselves supported.  The singletons :const:`None`, :const:`Ellipsis` and "
":exc:`StopIteration` can also be marshalled and unmarshalled. For format "
"*version* lower than 3, recursive lists, sets and dictionaries cannot be "
"written (see below)."
