"All functions in this module take a file descriptor *fd* as their first "
"argument.  This can be an integer file descriptor, such as returned by "
"``sys.stdin.fileno()``, or an :class:`io.IOBase` object, such as "
"``sys.stdin`` itself, which provides a :meth:`~io.IOBase.fileno` that "
"returns a genuine file descriptor."

"Perform the operation *cmd* on file descriptor *fd* (file objects providing "

"for *cmd* are operating system dependent, and are available as constants in "
"the :mod:`fcntl` module, using the same names as used in the relevant C "
"header files. The argument *arg* can either be an integer value, or a "
":class:`bytes` object. With an integer value, the return value of this "
"function is the integer return value of the C :c:func:`fcntl` call.  When "
"the argument is bytes it represents a binary structure, e.g. created by "
":func:`struct.pack`. The binary data is copied to a buffer whose address is "
"passed to the C :c:func:`fcntl` call.  The return value after a successful "
"call is the contents of the buffer, converted to a :class:`bytes` object. "
"The length of the returned object will be the same as the length of the "
"*arg* argument. This is limited to 1024 bytes. If the information returned "
"in the buffer by the operating system is larger than 1024 bytes, this is "
"most likely to result in a segmentation violation or a more subtle data "

" the action of the :func:`ioctl`.  This is a slight simplification, because "
