msgid ""
"This module performs file and I/O control on file descriptors. It is an "
"interface to the :c:func:`fcntl` and :c:func:`ioctl` Unix routines. See the "
":manpage:`fcntl(2)` and :manpage:`ioctl(2)` Unix manual pages for full "
"details."

"All functions in this module take a file descriptor *fd* as their first "
"argument.  This can be an integer file descriptor, such as returned by "
"``sys.stdin.fileno()``, or an :class:`io.IOBase` object, such as "
"``sys.stdin`` itself, which provides a :meth:`~io.IOBase.fileno` that "
"returns a genuine file descriptor."

"On macOS, the fcntl module exposes the ``F_GETPATH`` constant, which obtains"

msgid ""
"Perform the operation *cmd* on file descriptor *fd* (file objects providing "
"a :meth:`~io.IOBase.fileno` method are accepted as well).  The values used "
"for *cmd* are operating system dependent, and are available as constants in "
"the :mod:`fcntl` module, using the same names as used in the relevant C "
"header files. The argument *arg* can either be an integer value, or a "
":class:`bytes` object. With an integer value, the return value of this "
"function is the integer return value of the C :c:func:`fcntl` call.  When "
"the argument is bytes it represents a binary structure, e.g. created by "
":func:`struct.pack`. The binary data is copied to a buffer whose address is "
"passed to the C :c:func:`fcntl` call.  The return value after a successful "
"call is the contents of the buffer, converted to a :class:`bytes` object. "
"The length of the returned object will be the same as the length of the "
"*arg* argument. This is limited to 1024 bytes. If the information returned "
"in the buffer by the operating system is larger than 1024 bytes, this is "
"most likely to result in a segmentation violation or a more subtle data "
"corruption."

"If *mutate_flag* is true (the default), then the buffer is (in effect) "
"passed to the underlying :func:`ioctl` system call, the latter's return code"
" is passed back to the calling Python, and the buffer's new contents reflect"
" the action of the :func:`ioctl`.  This is a slight simplification, because "
