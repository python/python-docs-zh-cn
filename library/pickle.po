"*\"unpickling\"* is the inverse operation, whereby a byte stream (from a "
":term:`binary file` or :term:`bytes-like object`) is converted back into an "
"object hierarchy.  Pickling (and unpickling) is alternatively known as "
"\"serialization\", \"marshalling,\" [#]_ or \"flattening\"; however, to "
"avoid confusion, the terms used here are \"pickling\" and \"unpickling\"."

#: ../../library/pickle.rst:51

"The :mod:`pickle` module keeps track of the objects it has already "

":mod:`pickle` 模块会跟踪已被序列化的对象，所以该对象之后再次被引用时不会再次被序列化。:mod:`marshal` 不会这么做。"

#: ../../library/pickle.rst:55
msgid ""
"This has implications both for recursive objects and object sharing.  "
"Recursive objects are objects that contain references to themselves.  These "
"are not handled by marshal, and in fact, attempting to marshal recursive "
"objects will crash your Python interpreter.  Object sharing happens when "
"there are multiple references to the same object in different places in the "
"object hierarchy being serialized.  :mod:`pickle` stores such objects only "
"once, and ensures that all other references point to the master copy.  "
"Shared objects remain shared, which can be very important for mutable "
"objects."
msgstr ""
"这隐含了递归对象和共享对象。递归对象指包含对自己的引用的对象。这种对象并不会被 marshal 接受，并且实际上尝试 marshal 递归对象会让你的 "
"Python 解释器崩溃。对象共享发生在对象层级中存在多处引用同一对象时。:mod:`pickle` "
"只会存储这些对象一次，并确保其他的引用指向同一个主副本。共享对象将保持共享，这可能对可变对象非常重要。"

":mod:`marshal` cannot be used to serialize user-defined classes and their "
