"A :class:`~shlex.shlex` instance or subclass instance is a lexical analyzer "
"object.  The initialization argument, if present, specifies where to read "
"characters from.  It must be a file-/stream-like object with "
":meth:`~io.TextIOBase.read` and :meth:`~io.TextIOBase.readline` methods, or "
"a string.  If no argument is given, input will be taken from ``sys.stdin``. "
"The second optional argument is a filename string, which sets the initial "
"value of the :attr:`~shlex.infile` attribute.  If the *instream* argument is"
" omitted or equal to ``sys.stdin``, this second argument defaults to "
"\"stdin\".  The *posix* argument defines the operational mode: when *posix* "
"is not true (default), the :class:`~shlex.shlex` instance will operate in "
"compatibility mode.  When operating in POSIX mode, :class:`~shlex.shlex` "
"will try to be as close as possible to the POSIX shell parsing rules.  The "
"*punctuation_chars* argument provides a way to make the behaviour even "
"closer to how real shells parse.  This can take a number of values: the "
"default value, ``False``, preserves the behaviour seen under Python 3.5 and "
"earlier.  If set to ``True``, then parsing of the characters ``();<>|&`` is "
"changed: any run of these characters (considered punctuation characters) is "
"returned as a single token.  If set to a non-empty string of characters, "
"those characters will be used as the punctuation characters.  Any characters"
" in the :attr:`wordchars` attribute that appear in *punctuation_chars* will "
"be removed from :attr:`wordchars`.  See :ref:`improved-shell-compatibility` "

"The :class:`shlex` class provides compatibility with the parsing performed "

"in the constructor.  This defaults to ``False``, which preserves pre-3.6 "
"behaviour. However, if it is set to ``True``, then parsing of the characters"
" ``();<>|&`` is changed: any run of these characters is returned as a single"
" token.  While this is short of a full parser for shells (which would be out"
" of scope for the standard library, given the multiplicity of shells out "
"there), it does allow you to perform processing of command lines more easily"
" than you could otherwise.  To illustrate, you can see the difference in the"
