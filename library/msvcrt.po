"These functions provide access to some useful capabilities on Windows "
"platforms. Some higher-level modules use these functions to build the  "
"Windows implementations of their services.  For example, the :mod:`getpass` "
"module uses this in the implementation of the :func:`getpass` function."

"The module implements both the normal and wide char variants of the console "
"I/O api. The normal API deals only with ASCII characters and is of limited "
