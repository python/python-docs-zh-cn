"The :mod:`queue` module implements multi-producer, multi-consumer queues. It"
" is especially useful in threaded programming when information must be "
"exchanged safely between multiple threads.  The :class:`Queue` class in this"
" module implements all the required locking semantics."

msgid ""
"The module implements three types of queue, which differ only in the order "
"in which the entries are retrieved.  In a :abbr:`FIFO (first-in, first-out)`"
" queue, the first tasks added are the first retrieved.  In a :abbr:`LIFO "
"(last-in, first-out)` queue, the most recently added entry is the first "
"retrieved (operating like a stack).  With a priority queue, the entries are "
"kept sorted (using the :mod:`heapq` module) and the lowest valued entry is "
"retrieved first."
