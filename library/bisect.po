"This module provides support for maintaining a list in sorted order without "
"having to sort the list after each insertion.  For long lists of items with "
"expensive comparison operations, this can be an improvement over the more "
"common approach.  The module is called :mod:`bisect` because it uses a basic"
" bisection algorithm to do its work.  The source code may be most useful as "
"a working example of the algorithm (the boundary conditions are already "
"right!)."

"Locate the insertion point for *x* in *a* to maintain sorted order. The "

"should be considered; by default the entire list is used.  If *x* is already"
" present in *a*, the insertion point will be before (to the left of) any "
"existing entries.  The return value is suitable for use as the first "
"parameter to ``list.insert()`` assuming that *a* is already sorted."

"The search functions are stateless and discard key function results after "
"they are used.  Consequently, if the search functions are used in a loop, "
"the key function may be called again and again on the same array elements. "
"If the key function isn't fast, consider wrapping it with "
":py:func:`functools.cache` to avoid duplicate computations.  Alternatively, "
"consider searching an array of precomputed keys to locate the insertion "
"point (as shown in the examples section below)."
