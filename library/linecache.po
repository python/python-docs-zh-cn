"The :mod:`linecache` module allows one to get any line from a Python source "
"file, while attempting to optimize internally, using a cache, the common "
"case where many lines are read from a single file.  This is used by the "
":mod:`traceback` module to retrieve source lines for inclusion in  the "
"formatted traceback."

"The :func:`tokenize.open` function is used to open files. This function uses"
" :func:`tokenize.detect_encoding` to get the encoding of the file; in the "
"absence of an encoding token, the file encoding defaults to UTF-8."

#: ../../library/linecache.rst:22
msgid "The :mod:`linecache` module defines the following functions:"

#: ../../library/linecache.rst:27
msgid ""
"Get line *lineno* from file named *filename*. This function will never raise"
" an exception --- it will return ``''`` on errors (the terminating newline "
"character will be included for lines that are found)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/linecache.rst:33
msgid ""
"If a file named *filename* is not found, the function first checks for a "
":pep:`302` ``__loader__`` in *module_globals*. If there is such a loader and"
" it defines a ``get_source`` method, then that determines the source lines "
"(if ``get_source()`` returns ``None``, then ``''`` is returned). Finally, if"
" *filename* is a relative filename, it is looked up relative to the entries "
"in the module search path, ``sys.path``."

#: ../../library/linecache.rst:44

"Clear the cache.  Use this function if you no longer need lines from files "
"previously read using :func:`getline`."

#: ../../library/linecache.rst:50
msgid ""
"Check the cache for validity.  Use this function if files in the cache  may "
"have changed on disk, and you require the updated version.  If *filename* is"
" omitted, it will check all the entries in the cache."

msgid ""
"Capture enough detail about a non-file-based module to permit getting its "
"lines later via :func:`getline` even if *module_globals* is ``None`` in the "
"later call. This avoids doing I/O until a line is actually needed, without "
"having to carry the module globals around indefinitely."
