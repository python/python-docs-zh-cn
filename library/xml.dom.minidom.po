":mod:`xml.dom.minidom` is a minimal implementation of the Document Object "
"Model interface, with an API similar to that in other languages.  It is "
"intended to be simpler than the full DOM and also significantly smaller.  "
"Users who are not already proficient with the DOM should consider using the "
":mod:`xml.etree.ElementTree` module for their XML processing instead."

"parser and activate namespace support; other parser configuration (like "
"setting an entity resolver) must have been done in advance."

"What the :func:`parse` and :func:`parseString` functions do is connect an "
"XML parser with a \"DOM builder\" that can accept parse events from any SAX "
"parser and convert them into a DOM tree.  The name of the functions are "
"perhaps misleading, but are easy to grasp when learning the interfaces.  The"
" parsing of the document will be completed before these functions return; "

"themselves."
