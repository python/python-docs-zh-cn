":mod:`xml.dom.minidom` is a minimal implementation of the Document Object "
"Model interface, with an API similar to that in other languages.  It is "
"intended to be simpler than the full DOM and also significantly smaller.  "
"Users who are not already proficient with the DOM should consider using the "
":mod:`xml.etree.ElementTree` module for their XML processing instead."

"DOM applications typically start by parsing some XML into a DOM.  With "
":mod:`xml.dom.minidom`, this is done through the parse functions::"

"Return a :class:`Document` from the given input. *filename_or_file* may be "
"either a file name, or a file-like object. *parser*, if given, must be a "
"SAX2 parser object. This function will change the document handler of the "
"parser and activate namespace support; other parser configuration (like "
"setting an entity resolver) must have been done in advance."

"What the :func:`parse` and :func:`parseString` functions do is connect an "
"XML parser with a \"DOM builder\" that can accept parse events from any SAX "
"parser and convert them into a DOM tree.  The name of the functions are "
"perhaps misleading, but are easy to grasp when learning the interfaces.  The"
" parsing of the document will be completed before these functions return; "
"it's simply that these functions do not provide a parser implementation "
"themselves."

"You can also create a :class:`Document` by calling a method on a \"DOM "
"Implementation\" object.  You can get this object either by calling the "

"When you are finished with a DOM tree, you may optionally call the "
