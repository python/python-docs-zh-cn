"This module adds the ability to import Python modules (:file:`\\*.py`, "
":file:`\\*.pyc`) and packages from ZIP-format archives. It is usually not "
"needed to use the :mod:`zipimport` module explicitly; it is automatically "
"used by the built-in :keyword:`import` mechanism for :data:`sys.path` items "
"that are paths to ZIP archives."
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/zipimport.rst:19
msgid ""
"Typically, :data:`sys.path` is a list of directory names as strings.  This "
"module also allows an item of :data:`sys.path` to be a string naming a ZIP "
"file archive. The ZIP archive can contain a subdirectory structure to "
"support package imports, and a path within the archive can be specified to "
"only import from a subdirectory.  For example, the path "
":file:`example.zip/lib/` would only import from the :file:`lib/` "
"subdirectory within the archive."

#: ../../library/zipimport.rst:26
msgid ""
"Any files may be present in the ZIP archive, but importers are only invoked "
"for :file:`.py` and :file:`.pyc` files.  ZIP import of dynamic modules "
"(:file:`.pyd`, :file:`.so`) is disallowed. Note that if an archive only "
"contains :file:`.py` files, Python will not attempt to modify the archive by"
" adding the corresponding :file:`.pyc` file, meaning that if a ZIP archive "
"doesn't contain :file:`.pyc` files, importing may be rather slow."
