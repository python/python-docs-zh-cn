"The false value of the :class:`bool` type. Assignments to ``False`` are "
"illegal and raise a :exc:`SyntaxError`."

"The sole value of the type ``NoneType``.  ``None`` is frequently used to "
"represent the absence of a value, as when default arguments are not passed "
"to a function. Assignments to ``None`` are illegal and raise a "
":exc:`SyntaxError`."

"Special value which should be returned by the binary special methods (e.g. "
":meth:`__eq__`, :meth:`__lt__`, :meth:`__add__`, :meth:`__rsub__`, etc.) to "
"indicate that the operation is not implemented with respect to the other "
"type; may be returned by the in-place binary special methods (e.g. "
":meth:`__imul__`, :meth:`__iand__`, etc.) for the same purpose. It should "
"not be evaluated in a boolean context."

"When a binary (or in-place) method returns ``NotImplemented`` the "
"interpreter will try the reflected operation on the other type (or some "
"other fallback, depending on the operator).  If all attempts return "
"``NotImplemented``, the interpreter will raise an appropriate exception. "
"Incorrectly returning ``NotImplemented`` will result in a misleading error "
"message or the ``NotImplemented`` value being returned to Python code."

"Evaluating ``NotImplemented`` in a boolean context is deprecated. While it "
