"**urllib.request** is a Python module for fetching URLs (Uniform Resource "
"Locators). It offers a very simple interface, in the form of the *urlopen* "
"function. This is capable of fetching URLs using a variety of different "
"protocols. It also offers a slightly more complex interface for handling "
"common situations - like basic authentication, cookies, proxies and so on. "

"urllib.request supports fetching URLs for many \"URL schemes\" (identified "

"protocols (e.g. FTP, HTTP). This tutorial focuses on the most common case, "

"HTTP is based on requests and responses - the client makes requests and "
"servers send responses. urllib.request mirrors this with a ``Request`` "
"object which represents the HTTP request you are making. In its simplest "
"form you create a Request object that specifies the URL you want to fetch. "
"Calling ``urlopen`` with this Request object returns a response object for "
"the URL requested. This response is a file-like object, which means you can "
"for example call ``.read()`` on the response::"

"In the case of HTTP, there are two extra things that Request objects allow "
"you to do: First, you can pass data to be sent to the server.  Second, you "
"can pass extra information (\"metadata\") *about* the data or about the "
"request itself, to the server - this information is sent as HTTP "
"\"headers\".  Let's look at each of these in turn."

msgid ""
"Sometimes you want to send data to a URL (often the URL will refer to a CGI "
"(Common Gateway Interface) script or other web application). With HTTP, this"
" is often done using what's known as a **POST** request. This is often what "
"your browser does when you submit a HTML form that you filled in on the web."
" Not all POSTs have to come from forms: you can use a POST to transmit "
"arbitrary data to your own application. In the common case of HTML forms, "
"the data needs to be encoded in a standard way, and then passed to the "
"Request object as the ``data`` argument. The encoding is done using a "
"function from the :mod:`urllib.parse` library. ::"

"details)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../howto/urllib2.rst:136
msgid ""
"If you do not pass the ``data`` argument, urllib uses a **GET** request. One"
" way in which GET and POST requests differ is that POST requests often have "
"\"side-effects\": they change the state of the system in some way (for "
"example by placing an order with the website for a hundredweight of tinned "
"spam to be delivered to your door).  Though the HTTP standard makes it clear"
" that POSTs are intended to *always* cause side-effects, and GET requests "
"*never* to cause side-effects, nothing prevents a GET request from having "
"side-effects, nor a POST requests from having no side-effects. Data can also"
