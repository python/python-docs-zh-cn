"Everything started with a post by Samuele Pedroni to the Python development "

"resolution order is not monotonic and he proposed to replace it with the C3 "
"method resolution order.  Guido agreed with his arguments and therefore now "
"Python 2.3 uses C3.  The C3 method itself has nothing to do with Python, "
"since it was invented by people working on Dylan and it is described in a "
"paper intended for lispers [#]_.  The present paper gives a (hopefully) "

"maintain their old method resolution order, depth first and then left to "
"right.  Therefore, there is no breaking of old code for classic classes; and"
" even if in principle there could be breaking of code for Python 2.2 new "
"style classes, in practice the cases in which the C3 resolution order "
"differs from the Python 2.2 method resolution order are so rare that no real"

"Given a class C in a complicated multiple inheritance hierarchy, it is a "

msgstr ""

#: ../../howto/mro.rst:79

"The list of the ancestors of a class C, including the class itself, ordered "

msgid ""
"The *Method Resolution Order* (MRO) is the set of rules that construct the "

" used as a synonymous for the linearization of the class C."
msgstr ""

#: ../../howto/mro.rst:88
msgid ""
"For instance, in the case of single inheritance hierarchy, if C is a "
"subclass of C1, and C1 is a subclass of C2, then the linearization of C is "
"simply the list [C, C1 , C2].  However, with multiple inheritance "
"hierarchies, the construction of the linearization is more cumbersome, since"
" it is more difficult to construct a linearization that respects *local "
"precedence ordering* and *monotonicity*."
msgstr ""

#: ../../howto/mro.rst:96
msgid ""
"I will discuss the local precedence ordering later, but I can give the "
"definition of monotonicity here.  A MRO is monotonic when the following is "
"true:  *if C1 precedes C2 in the linearization of C, then C1 precedes C2 in "
"the linearization of any subclass of C*. Otherwise, the innocuous operation "
"of deriving a new class could change the resolution order of methods, "
