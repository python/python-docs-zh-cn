"Logging is a means of tracking events that happen when some software runs. "
"The software's developer adds logging calls to their code to indicate that "
"certain events have occurred. An event is described by a descriptive message"
" which can optionally contain variable data (i.e. data that is potentially "
"different for each occurrence of the event). Events also have an importance "
"which the developer ascribes to the event; the importance can also be called"
" the *level* or *severity*."
