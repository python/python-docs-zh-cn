"Starting with the 3.13 release, CPython has experimental support for a build"
" of Python called :term:`free threading` where the :term:`global interpreter"
" lock` (GIL) is disabled.  Free-threaded execution allows for full "
"utilization of the available processing power by running threads in parallel"
" on available CPU cores. While not all software will benefit from this "
"automatically, programs designed with threading in mind will run faster on "
"multi-core hardware."
