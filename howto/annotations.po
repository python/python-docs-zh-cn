msgid ""
"Python 3.10 adds a new function to the standard library: "
":func:`inspect.get_annotations`.  In Python versions 3.10 and newer, calling"
" this function is the best practice for accessing the annotations dict of "
"any object that supports annotations.  This function can also \"un-"
"stringize\" stringized annotations for you."
msgstr ""

#: ../../howto/annotations.rst:42
msgid ""
"If for some reason :func:`inspect.get_annotations` isn't viable for your use"
" case, you may access the ``__annotations__`` data member manually.  Best "
"practice for this changed in Python 3.10 as well: as of Python 3.10, "
"``o.__annotations__`` is guaranteed to *always* work on Python functions, "
"classes, and modules.  If you're certain the object you're examining is one "
"of these three *specific* objects, you may simply use ``o.__annotations__`` "
"to get at the object's annotations dict."
msgstr ""

#: ../../howto/annotations.rst:52
msgid ""
"However, other types of callables--for example, callables created by "
":func:`functools.partial`--may not have an ``__annotations__`` attribute "
"defined.  When accessing the ``__annotations__`` of a possibly unknown "
"object,  best practice in Python versions 3.10 and newer is to call "
":func:`getattr` with three arguments, for example ``getattr(o, "
"'__annotations__', None)``."

"In Python 3.9 and older, accessing the annotations dict of an object is much"
" more complicated than in newer versions. The problem is a design flaw in "
"these older versions of Python, specifically to do with class annotations."

"Best practice for accessing the annotations dict of other objects--"
"functions, other callables, and modules--is the same as best practice for "
"3.10, assuming you aren't calling :func:`inspect.get_annotations`: you "
"should use three-argument :func:`getattr` to access the object's "
"``__annotations__`` attribute."
msgstr ""

#: ../../howto/annotations.rst:76
msgid ""
"Unfortunately, this isn't best practice for classes.  The problem is that, "
"since ``__annotations__`` is optional on classes, and because classes can "
"inherit attributes from their base classes, accessing the "
"``__annotations__`` attribute of a class may inadvertently return the "
"annotations dict of a *base class.* As an example::"

#: ../../howto/annotations.rst:95

"Your code will have to have a separate code path if the object you're "
"examining is a class (``isinstance(o, type)``). In that case, best practice "
"relies on an implementation detail of Python 3.9 and before: if a class has "
"annotations defined, they are stored in the class's ``__dict__`` dictionary."
"  Since the class may or may not have annotations defined, best practice is "
"to call the ``get`` method on the class dict."
