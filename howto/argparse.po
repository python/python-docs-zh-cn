"There are two other modules that fulfill the same task, namely :mod:`getopt`"

":mod:`optparse`, and therefore very similar in terms of usage."

msgid "A few concepts we can learn from the four commands:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../howto/argparse.rst:48
msgid ""
"The :command:`ls` command is useful when run without any options at all. It "
"defaults to displaying the contents of the current directory."
msgstr ""

#: ../../howto/argparse.rst:51
msgid ""
"If we want beyond what it provides by default, we tell it a bit more. In "
"this case, we want it to display a different directory, ``pypy``. What we "
"did is specify what is known as a positional argument. It's named so because"
" the program should know what to do with the value, solely based on where it"
" appears on the command line. This concept is more relevant to a command "
"like :command:`cp`, whose most basic usage is ``cp SRC DEST``. The first "
"position is *what you want copied,* and the second position is *where you "
"want it copied to*."
msgstr ""

#: ../../howto/argparse.rst:60
msgid ""
"Now, say we want to change behaviour of the program. In our example, we "
"display more info for each file instead of just showing the file names. The "
"``-l`` in that case is known as an optional argument."

#: ../../howto/argparse.rst:64

"That's a snippet of the help text. It's very useful in that you can come "

#: ../../howto/argparse.rst:103
msgid ""
"The ``--help`` option, which can also be shortened to ``-h``, is the only "

msgid ""
"We've added the :meth:`add_argument` method, which is what we use to specify"

"The :meth:`parse_args` method actually returns some data from the options "

#: ../../howto/argparse.rst:149
msgid ""
"The variable is some form of 'magic' that :mod:`argparse` performs for free "
"(i.e. no need to specify which variable that value is stored in). You will "
"also notice that its name matches the string argument given to the method, "
"``echo``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../howto/argparse.rst:154
msgid ""
"Note however that, although the help display looks nice and all, it "
"currently is not as helpful as it can be. For example we see that we got "
"``echo`` as a positional argument, but we don't know what it does, other "
"than by guessing or by reading the source code. So, let's make it a bit more"
" useful::"

#: ../../howto/argparse.rst:178
msgid "Now, how about doing something even more useful::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../howto/argparse.rst:196
msgid ""
"That didn't go so well. That's because :mod:`argparse` treats the options we"
" give it as strings, unless we tell it otherwise. So, let's tell "
":mod:`argparse` to treat that input as an integer::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../howto/argparse.rst:217

"The program is written so as to display something when ``--verbosity`` is "

#: ../../howto/argparse.rst:257
msgid ""
"To show that the option is actually optional, there is no error when running"
" the program without it. Note that by default, if an optional argument isn't"

"``None`` as a value, which is the reason it fails the truth test of the "
":keyword:`if` statement."

msgid ""
"The above example accepts arbitrary integer values for ``--verbosity``, but "
"for our simple program, only two values are actually useful, ``True`` or "
"``False``. Let's modify the code accordingly::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../howto/argparse.rst:298
msgid ""
"The option is now more of a flag than something that requires a value. We "
"even changed the name of the option to match that idea. Note that we now "
"specify a new keyword, ``action``, and give it the value ``\"store_true\"``."
" This means that, if the option is specified, assign the value ``True`` to "
":data:`args.verbose`. Not specifying it implies ``False``."

"These all look good except the last one, which exposes a bug in our program."

"Note that the change also reflects both in the error message as well as the "
"help string."

"Now, let's use a different approach of playing with verbosity, which is "

"We have introduced another action, \"count\", to count the number of "

msgid ""
"Yes, it's now more of a flag (similar to ``action=\"store_true\"``) in the "

#: ../../howto/argparse.rst:501
msgid "It also behaves similar to \"store_true\" action."

"Now here's a demonstration of what the \"count\" action gives. You've "
"probably seen this sort of usage before."

"And if you don't specify the ``-v`` flag, that flag is considered to have "

"We've just introduced yet another keyword, ``default``. We've set it to "
"``0`` in order to make it comparable to the other int values. Remember that "
"by default, if an optional argument isn't specified, it gets the ``None`` "
"value, and that cannot be compared to an int value (hence the "
":exc:`TypeError` exception)."

"Our program is now simpler, and we've lost some functionality for the sake "
