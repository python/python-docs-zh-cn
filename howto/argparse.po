msgid "A few concepts we can learn from the four commands:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../howto/argparse.rst:50
msgid ""
"The :command:`ls` command is useful when run without any options at all. It "
"defaults to displaying the contents of the current directory."
msgstr ""

#: ../../howto/argparse.rst:53
msgid ""
"If we want beyond what it provides by default, we tell it a bit more. In "
"this case, we want it to display a different directory, ``pypy``. What we "
"did is specify what is known as a positional argument. It's named so because"
" the program should know what to do with the value, solely based on where it"
" appears on the command line. This concept is more relevant to a command "
"like :command:`cp`, whose most basic usage is ``cp SRC DEST``. The first "
"position is *what you want copied,* and the second position is *where you "
"want it copied to*."
msgstr ""

#: ../../howto/argparse.rst:62
msgid ""
"Now, say we want to change behaviour of the program. In our example, we "
"display more info for each file instead of just showing the file names. The "
"``-l`` in that case is known as an optional argument."

#: ../../howto/argparse.rst:66

"That's a snippet of the help text. It's very useful in that you can come "

msgid ""
"The ``--help`` option, which can also be shortened to ``-h``, is the only "

msgid ""
"We've added the :meth:`~ArgumentParser.add_argument` method, which is what "
"we use to specify which command-line options the program is willing to "
"accept. In this case, I've named it ``echo`` so that it's in line with its "
"function."

msgid ""
"The variable is some form of 'magic' that :mod:`argparse` performs for free "

"``echo``."

#: ../../howto/argparse.rst:156
msgid ""
"Note however that, although the help display looks nice and all, it "
"currently is not as helpful as it can be. For example we see that we got "

msgid "Now, how about doing something even more useful::"

#: ../../howto/argparse.rst:198
msgid ""
"That didn't go so well. That's because :mod:`argparse` treats the options we"

":mod:`argparse` to treat that input as an integer::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../howto/argparse.rst:219

"To show that the option is actually optional, there is no error when running"

"The above example accepts arbitrary integer values for ``--verbosity``, but "
"for our simple program, only two values are actually useful, ``True`` or "
"``False``. Let's modify the code accordingly::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../howto/argparse.rst:300
msgid ""
"The option is now more of a flag than something that requires a value. We "
"even changed the name of the option to match that idea. Note that we now "
"specify a new keyword, ``action``, and give it the value ``\"store_true\"``."
" This means that, if the option is specified, assign the value ``True`` to "
"``args.verbose``. Not specifying it implies ``False``."

"We have introduced another action, \"count\", to count the number of "

"We've just introduced yet another keyword, ``default``. We've set it to "
