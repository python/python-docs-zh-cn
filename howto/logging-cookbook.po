"underlying logger. The default implementation of this method leaves the "
"message alone, but inserts an 'extra' key in the keyword argument whose "

"target handler, a level at which flushing should occur, and a capacity for "
"the buffer. These default to a :class:`~logging.StreamHandler` which writes "
