"In 1968, the American Standard Code for Information Interchange, better "
"known by its acronym ASCII, was standardized.  ASCII defined numeric codes "
"for various characters, with the numeric values running from 0 to 127.  For "
"example, the lowercase letter 'a' is assigned 97 as its code value."
msgstr ""

#: ../../howto/unicode.rst:24

"ASCII was an American-developed standard, so it only defined unaccented "
"characters.  There was an 'e', but no 'é' or 'Í'.  This meant that languages"
" which required accented characters couldn't be faithfully represented in "
"ASCII. (Actually the missing accents matter for English, too, which contains"
" words such as 'naïve' and 'café', and some publications have house styles "
"which require spellings such as 'coöperate'.)"

"In the 1980s, almost all personal computers were 8-bit, meaning that bytes "
"could hold values ranging from 0 to 255.  ASCII codes only went up to 127, "
"so some machines assigned values between 128 and 255 to accented characters."
"  Different machines had different codes, however, which led to problems "
"exchanging files. Eventually various commonly used sets of values for the "
"128--255 range emerged. Some were true standards, defined by the "
"International Organization for Standardization, and some were *de facto* "
"conventions that were invented by one company or another and managed to "

"A **character** is the smallest possible component of a text.  'A', 'B', "
"'C', etc., are all different characters.  So are 'È' and 'Í'.  Characters "
"are abstractions, and vary depending on the language or context you're "
"talking about.  For example, the symbol for ohms (Ω) is usually drawn much "
"like the capital letter omega (Ω) in the Greek alphabet (they may even be "
"the same in some fonts), but these are two different characters that have "
"different meanings."

"The Unicode standard describes how characters are represented by **code "
"points**.  A code point is an integer value, usually denoted in base 16.  In"
" the standard, a code point is written using the notation ``U+12CA`` to mean"
" the character with value ``0x12ca`` (4,810 decimal).  The Unicode standard "
"contains a lot of tables listing characters and their corresponding code "
"points:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../howto/unicode.rst:107
msgid ""
"Strictly, these definitions imply that it's meaningless to say 'this is "

"SYLLABLE WI'.  In informal contexts, this distinction between code points "
"and characters will sometimes be forgotten."

"A character is represented on a screen or on paper by a set of graphical "

"To summarize the previous section: a Unicode string is a sequence of code "
"points, which are numbers from 0 through ``0x10FFFF`` (1,114,111 decimal).  "
"This sequence needs to be represented as a set of bytes (meaning, values "
"from 0 through 255) in memory.  The rules for translating a Unicode string "
"into a sequence of bytes are called an **encoding**."

"It's very wasteful of space.  In most texts, the majority of the code points"

"``0x00`` bytes.  The above string takes 24 bytes compared to the 6 bytes "
"needed for an ASCII representation.  Increased RAM usage doesn't matter too "
"much (desktop computers have gigabytes of RAM, and strings aren't usually "

"Encodings don't have to handle every possible Unicode character, and most "

msgid ""
"Latin-1, also known as ISO-8859-1, is a similar encoding.  Unicode code "

"UTF-8 is one of the most commonly used encodings.  UTF stands for \"Unicode "
