"Although changing the C-API was not one of Python 3's objectives, the many "
"Python-level changes made leaving Python 2's API intact impossible.  In "
"fact, some changes such as :func:`int` and :func:`long` unification are more"
" obvious on the C level.  This document endeavors to document "

"Python 3's :func:`str` type is equivalent to Python 2's :func:`unicode`; the"
" C functions are called ``PyUnicode_*`` for both.  The old 8-bit string type"
" has become :func:`bytes`, with C functions called ``PyBytes_*``.  Python "
"2.6 and later provide a compatibility header, :file:`bytesobject.h`, mapping"
" ``PyBytes`` names to ``PyString`` ones.  For best compatibility with Python"
" 3, :c:type:`PyUnicode` should be used for textual data and "
":c:type:`PyBytes` for binary data.  It's also important to remember that "
":c:type:`PyBytes` and :c:type:`PyUnicode` in Python 3 are not "
"interchangeable like :c:type:`PyString` and :c:type:`PyUnicode` are in "
"Python 2.  The following example shows best practices with regards to "
":c:type:`PyUnicode`, :c:type:`PyString`, and :c:type:`PyBytes`. ::"

"Python 3 has a revamped extension module initialization system.  (See "

#: ../../howto/cporting.rst:199
msgid ""
"The :c:type:`Capsule` object was introduced in Python 3.1 and 2.7 to replace"
" :c:type:`CObject`.  CObjects were useful, but the :c:type:`CObject` API was"
" problematic: it didn't permit distinguishing between valid CObjects, which "
"allowed mismatched CObjects to crash the interpreter, and some of its APIs "
"relied on undefined behavior in C. (For further reading on the rationale "
"behind Capsules, please see :issue:`5630`.)"

"If you're currently using CObjects, and you want to migrate to 3.1 or newer,"

"and 2.7 and completely removed in Python 3.2.  If you only support 2.7, or "
"3.1 and above, you can simply switch to :c:type:`Capsule`.  If you need to "
"support Python 3.0, or versions of Python earlier than 2.7, you'll have to "
"support both CObjects and Capsules. (Note that Python 3.0 is no longer "

"The following example header file :file:`capsulethunk.h` may solve the "
