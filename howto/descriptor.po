"In general, a descriptor is an object attribute with \"binding behavior\", "
"one whose attribute access has been overridden by methods in the descriptor "
"protocol.  Those methods are :meth:`__get__`, :meth:`__set__`, and "
":meth:`__delete__`.  If any of those methods are defined for an object, it "
"is said to be a descriptor."
msgstr ""

#: ../../howto/descriptor.rst:32
msgid ""
"The default behavior for attribute access is to get, set, or delete the "
"attribute from an object's dictionary.  For instance, ``a.x`` has a lookup "
"chain starting with ``a.__dict__['x']``, then ``type(a).__dict__['x']``, and"
" continuing through the base classes of ``type(a)`` excluding metaclasses. "
"If the looked-up value is an object defining one of the descriptor methods, "
"then Python may override the default behavior and invoke the descriptor "
"method instead. Where this occurs in the precedence chain depends on which "
"descriptor methods were defined."

"Descriptors are a powerful, general purpose protocol.  They are the "
"mechanism behind properties, methods, static methods, class methods, and "
":func:`super()`. They are used throughout Python itself to implement the new"
" style classes introduced in version 2.2.  Descriptors simplify the "
"underlying C-code and offer a flexible set of new tools for everyday Python "
"programs."

"Alternatively, it is more common for a descriptor to be invoked "

"For objects, the machinery is in :meth:`object.__getattribute__` which "
"transforms ``b.x`` into ``type(b).__dict__['x'].__get__(b, type(b))``.  The "

"priority over instance variables, instance variables priority over non-data "

"The object returned by ``super()`` also has a custom "

"Class dictionaries store methods as functions.  In a class definition, "
