"Sockets are used nearly everywhere, but are one of the most severely "
"misunderstood technologies around. This is a 10,000 foot overview of "
"sockets. It's not really a tutorial - you'll still have work to do in "
"getting things operational. It doesn't cover the fine points (and there are "
"a lot of them), but I hope it will give you enough background to begin using"

"I'm only going to talk about INET (i.e. IPv4) sockets, but they account for "
"at least 99% of the sockets in use. And I'll only talk about STREAM (i.e. "
"TCP) sockets - unless you really know what you're doing (in which case this "
"HOWTO isn't for you!), you'll get better behavior and performance from a "
"STREAM socket than anything else. I will try to clear up the mystery of what"
" a socket is, as well as some hints on how to work with blocking and non-"

"Part of the trouble with understanding these things is that \"socket\" can "
"mean a number of subtly different things, depending on context. So first, "
"let's make a distinction between a \"client\" socket - an endpoint of a "
"conversation, and a \"server\" socket, which is more like a switchboard "
"operator. The client application (your browser, for example) uses \"client\""
" sockets exclusively; the web server it's talking to uses both \"server\" "
"sockets and \"client\" sockets."

"Of the various forms of :abbr:`IPC (Inter Process Communication)`, sockets "

"A couple things to notice: we used ``socket.gethostname()`` so that the "
"socket would be visible to the outside world.  If we had used "
"``s.bind(('localhost', 80))`` or ``s.bind(('127.0.0.1', 80))`` we would "
"still have a \"server\" socket, but one that was only visible within the "
"same machine.  ``s.bind(('', 80))`` specifies that the socket is reachable "
"by any address the machine happens to have."

"There's actually 3 general ways in which this loop could work - dispatching "

"multiplex between our \"server\" socket and any active ``clientsocket``\\ s "
"using ``select``. More about that later. The important thing to understand "
"now is this: this is *all* a \"server\" socket does. It doesn't send any "
"data. It doesn't receive any data. It just produces \"client\" sockets. Each"
" ``clientsocket`` is created in response to some *other* \"client\" socket "
"doing a ``connect()`` to the host and port we're bound to. As soon as we've "
"created that ``clientsocket``, we go back to listening for more connections."

"The first thing to note, is that the web browser's \"client\" socket and the"

"\"peer to peer\" conversation. Or to put it another way, *as the designer, "
"you will have to decide what the rules of etiquette are for a conversation*."

"Now there are two sets of verbs to use for communication. You can use "
"``send`` and ``recv``, or you can transform your client socket into a file-"
"like beast and use ``read`` and ``write``. The latter is the way Java "
"presents its sockets. I'm not going to talk about it here, except to warn "
"you that you need to use ``flush`` on sockets. These are buffered \"files\","
" and a common mistake is to ``write`` something, and then ``read`` for a "
"reply. Without a ``flush`` in there, you may wait forever for the reply, "
"because the request may still be in your output buffer."
msgstr ""

#: ../../howto/sockets.rst:152
msgid ""
"Now we come to the major stumbling block of sockets - ``send`` and ``recv`` "
"operate on the network buffers. They do not necessarily handle all the bytes"
" you hand them (or expect from them), because their major focus is handling "
"the network buffers. In general, they return when the associated network "
"buffers have been filled (``send``) or emptied (``recv``). They then tell "
"you how many bytes they handled. It is *your* responsibility to call them "
"again until your message has been completely dealt with."
msgstr ""

#: ../../howto/sockets.rst:160
msgid ""
"When a ``recv`` returns 0 bytes, it means the other side has closed (or is "
"in the process of closing) the connection.  You will not receive any more "

"I'll talk more about this later."

"A protocol like HTTP uses a socket for only one transfer. The client sends a"

"means that a client can detect the end of the reply by receiving 0 bytes."
msgstr ""

#: ../../howto/sockets.rst:169
msgid ""
"But if you plan to reuse your socket for further transfers, you need to "
"realize that *there is no* :abbr:`EOT (End of Transfer)` *on a socket.* I "
"repeat: if a socket ``send`` or ``recv`` returns after handling 0 bytes, the"
" connection has been broken.  If the connection has *not* been broken, you "
"may wait on a ``recv`` forever, because the socket will *not* tell you that "
"there's nothing more to read (for now).  Now if you think about that a bit, "
"you'll come to realize a fundamental truth of sockets: *messages must either"
" be fixed length* (yuck), *or be delimited* (shrug), *or indicate how long "
"they are* (much better), *or end by shutting down the connection*. The "
"choice is entirely yours, (but some ways are righter than others)."

msgid ""
"The sending code here is usable for almost any messaging scheme - in Python "
"you send strings, and you can use ``len()`` to determine its length (even if"
" it has embedded ``\\0`` characters). It's mostly the receiving code that "
"gets more complex. (And in C, it's not much worse, except you can't use "
"``strlen`` if the message has embedded ``\\0``\\ s.)"
msgstr ""

#: ../../howto/sockets.rst:223
msgid ""
"The easiest enhancement is to make the first character of the message an "
"indicator of message type, and have the type determine the length. Now you "
"have two ``recv``\\ s - the first to get (at least) that first character so "
"you can look up the length, and the second in a loop to get the rest. If you"
" decide to go the delimited route, you'll be receiving in some arbitrary "
"chunk size, (4096 or 8192 is frequently a good match for network buffer "
"sizes), and scanning what you've received for a delimiter."
msgstr ""

#: ../../howto/sockets.rst:231
msgid ""
"One complication to be aware of: if your conversational protocol allows "
"multiple messages to be sent back to back (without some kind of reply), and "
"you pass ``recv`` an arbitrary chunk size, you may end up reading the start "
"of a following message. You'll need to put that aside and hold onto it, "
"until it's needed."
msgstr ""

#: ../../howto/sockets.rst:237
msgid ""
"Prefixing the message with its length (say, as 5 numeric characters) gets "
"more complex, because (believe it or not), you may not get all 5 characters "
"in one ``recv``. In playing around, you'll get away with it; but in high "
"network loads, your code will very quickly break unless you use two ``recv``"
" loops - the first to determine the length, the second to get the data part "
"of the message. Nasty. This is also when you'll discover that ``send`` does "
"not always manage to get rid of everything in one pass. And despite having "

"example, `network byte order "
"<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness#Networking>`_ is big-endian, with "
"the most significant byte first, so a 16 bit integer with the value ``1`` "

"Strictly speaking, you're supposed to use ``shutdown`` on a socket before "

"other end. Depending on the argument you pass it, it can mean \"I'm not "
"going to send anymore, but I'll still listen\", or \"I'm not listening, good"
" riddance!\".  Most socket libraries, however, are so used to programmers "
"neglecting to use this piece of etiquette that normally a ``close`` is the "
"same as ``shutdown(); close()``.  So in most situations, an explicit "
"``shutdown`` is not needed."
msgstr ""

#: ../../howto/sockets.rst:287
msgid ""
"One way to use ``shutdown`` effectively is in an HTTP-like exchange. The "
"client sends a request and then does a ``shutdown(1)``. This tells the "
"server \"This client is done sending, but can still receive.\"  The server "

"Python takes the automatic shutdown a step further, and says that when a "
