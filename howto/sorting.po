"Python lists have a built-in :meth:`list.sort` method that modifies the list"

"A simple ascending sort is very easy: just call the :func:`sorted` function."
" It returns a new sorted list::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../howto/sorting.rst:26
msgid ""
"You can also use the :meth:`list.sort` method. It modifies the list in-place"
" (and returns ``None`` to avoid confusion). Usually it's less convenient "
"than :func:`sorted` - but if you don't need the original list, it's slightly"
" more efficient."
msgstr ""

#: ../../howto/sorting.rst:36
msgid ""
"Another difference is that the :meth:`list.sort` method is only defined for "
"lists. In contrast, the :func:`sorted` function accepts any iterable."

msgid "Key Functions"
msgstr ""

#: ../../howto/sorting.rst:45
msgid ""
"Both :meth:`list.sort` and :func:`sorted` have a *key* parameter to specify "
"a function (or other callable) to be called on each list element prior to "
"making comparisons."
msgstr ""

#: ../../howto/sorting.rst:49
msgid "For example, here's a case-insensitive string comparison:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../howto/sorting.rst:54
msgid ""
"The value of the *key* parameter should be a function (or other callable) "
"that takes a single argument and returns a key to use for sorting purposes. "
"This technique is fast because the key function is called exactly once for "
"each input record."
msgstr ""

#: ../../howto/sorting.rst:59
msgid ""
"A common pattern is to sort complex objects using some of the object's "
"indices as keys. For example:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../howto/sorting.rst:70

"The same technique works for objects with named attributes. For example:"

msgid "Operator Module Functions"
msgstr ""

#: ../../howto/sorting.rst:91
msgid ""
"The key-function patterns shown above are very common, so Python provides "
"convenience functions to make accessor functions easier and faster. The "
":mod:`operator` module has :func:`~operator.itemgetter`, "
":func:`~operator.attrgetter`, and a :func:`~operator.methodcaller` function."
msgstr ""

#: ../../howto/sorting.rst:96
msgid "Using those functions, the above examples become simpler and faster:"

#: ../../howto/sorting.rst:106

msgid "Sort Stability and Complex Sorts"
msgstr ""

#: ../../howto/sorting.rst:131
msgid ""
"Sorts are guaranteed to be `stable "
"<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm#Stability>`_\\. That means "
"that when multiple records have the same key, their original order is "
"preserved."
msgstr ""

#: ../../howto/sorting.rst:139
msgid ""
"Notice how the two records for *blue* retain their original order so that "
"``('blue', 1)`` is guaranteed to precede ``('blue', 2)``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../howto/sorting.rst:142
msgid ""
"This wonderful property lets you build complex sorts in a series of sorting "
"steps. For example, to sort the student data by descending *grade* and then "
"ascending *age*, do the *age* sort first and then sort again using *grade*:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../howto/sorting.rst:150
msgid ""
"This can be abstracted out into a wrapper function that can take a list and "
"tuples of field and order to sort them on multiple passes."
msgstr ""

#: ../../howto/sorting.rst:161

"The `Timsort <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timsort>`_ algorithm used in "
"Python does multiple sorts efficiently because it can take advantage of any "

msgid "The Old Way Using Decorate-Sort-Undecorate"
msgstr ""

#: ../../howto/sorting.rst:168
msgid "This idiom is called Decorate-Sort-Undecorate after its three steps:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../howto/sorting.rst:170
msgid ""
"First, the initial list is decorated with new values that control the sort "
"order."
msgstr ""

#: ../../howto/sorting.rst:172
msgid "Second, the decorated list is sorted."
msgstr ""

#: ../../howto/sorting.rst:174
msgid ""
"Finally, the decorations are removed, creating a list that contains only the"
" initial values in the new order."
msgstr ""

#: ../../howto/sorting.rst:177
msgid ""
"For example, to sort the student data by *grade* using the DSU approach:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../howto/sorting.rst:184
msgid ""
"This idiom works because tuples are compared lexicographically; the first "
"items are compared; if they are the same then the second items are compared,"
" and so on."
msgstr ""

#: ../../howto/sorting.rst:188
msgid ""
"It is not strictly necessary in all cases to include the index *i* in the "
"decorated list, but including it gives two benefits:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../howto/sorting.rst:191
msgid ""
"The sort is stable -- if two items have the same key, their order will be "
"preserved in the sorted list."
msgstr ""

#: ../../howto/sorting.rst:194
msgid ""
"The original items do not have to be comparable because the ordering of the "
"decorated tuples will be determined by at most the first two items. So for "
"example the original list could contain complex numbers which cannot be "
"sorted directly."
msgstr ""

#: ../../howto/sorting.rst:199
msgid ""
"Another name for this idiom is `Schwartzian transform "
"<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwartzian_transform>`_\\, after Randal L. "
"Schwartz, who popularized it among Perl programmers."

"Now that Python sorting provides key-functions, this technique is not often "
"needed."

msgid "The Old Way Using the *cmp* Parameter"
msgstr ""

#: ../../howto/sorting.rst:209
msgid ""
"Many constructs given in this HOWTO assume Python 2.4 or later. Before that,"
" there was no :func:`sorted` builtin and :meth:`list.sort` took no keyword "
"arguments. Instead, all of the Py2.x versions supported a *cmp* parameter to"
" handle user specified comparison functions."
msgstr ""

#: ../../howto/sorting.rst:214
msgid ""
"In Py3.0, the *cmp* parameter was removed entirely (as part of a larger "
"effort to simplify and unify the language, eliminating the conflict between "
"rich comparisons and the :meth:`__cmp__` magic method)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../howto/sorting.rst:218
msgid ""
"In Py2.x, sort allowed an optional function which can be called for doing "
"the comparisons. That function should take two arguments to be compared and "
"then return a negative value for less-than, return zero if they are equal, "
"or return a positive value for greater-than. For example, we can do:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../howto/sorting.rst:228
msgid "Or you can reverse the order of comparison with:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../howto/sorting.rst:235
msgid ""
"When porting code from Python 2.x to 3.x, the situation can arise when you "
"have the user supplying a comparison function and you need to convert that "
"to a key function. The following wrapper makes that easy to do::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../howto/sorting.rst:258
msgid "To convert to a key function, just wrap the old comparison function:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../howto/sorting.rst:269
msgid ""
"In Python 3.2, the :func:`functools.cmp_to_key` function was added to the "
":mod:`functools` module in the standard library."
msgstr ""

#: ../../howto/sorting.rst:273
msgid "Odd and Ends"
msgstr ""

#: ../../howto/sorting.rst:275
msgid ""
"For locale aware sorting, use :func:`locale.strxfrm` for a key function or "
":func:`locale.strcoll` for a comparison function."
msgstr ""

#: ../../howto/sorting.rst:278
msgid ""
"The *reverse* parameter still maintains sort stability (so that records with"
" equal keys retain the original order). Interestingly, that effect can be "
"simulated without the parameter by using the builtin :func:`reversed` "
"function twice:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../howto/sorting.rst:290
msgid ""
"The sort routines use ``<`` when making comparisons between two objects. So,"
" it is easy to add a standard sort order to a class by defining an "
":meth:`__lt__` method::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../howto/sorting.rst:298
msgid ""
"However, note that ``<`` can fall back to using :meth:`__gt__` if "
":meth:`__lt__` is not implemented (see :func:`object.__lt__`)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../howto/sorting.rst:301
msgid ""
"Key functions need not depend directly on the objects being sorted. A key "
"function can also access external resources. For instance, if the student "
"grades are stored in a dictionary, they can be used to sort a separate list "
"of student names:"
msgstr ""
