"Python lists have a built-in :meth:`list.sort` method that modifies the list"
" in-place.  There is also a :func:`sorted` built-in function that builds a "
"new sorted list from an iterable."

msgid ""
"A simple ascending sort is very easy: just call the :func:`sorted` function."
" It returns a new sorted list:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../howto/sorting.rst:28
msgid ""
"You can also use the :meth:`list.sort` method. It modifies the list in-place"
" (and returns ``None`` to avoid confusion). Usually it's less convenient "
"than :func:`sorted` - but if you don't need the original list, it's slightly"
" more efficient."
msgstr ""

#: ../../howto/sorting.rst:40
msgid ""
"Another difference is that the :meth:`list.sort` method is only defined for "
"lists. In contrast, the :func:`sorted` function accepts any iterable."
msgstr ""

#: ../../howto/sorting.rst:49
msgid "Key Functions"
msgstr ""

#: ../../howto/sorting.rst:51
msgid ""
"Both :meth:`list.sort` and :func:`sorted` have a *key* parameter to specify "
"a function (or other callable) to be called on each list element prior to "
"making comparisons."
msgstr ""

#: ../../howto/sorting.rst:55
msgid "For example, here's a case-insensitive string comparison:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../howto/sorting.rst:62
msgid ""
"The value of the *key* parameter should be a function (or other callable) "
"that takes a single argument and returns a key to use for sorting purposes. "
"This technique is fast because the key function is called exactly once for "
"each input record."
msgstr ""

#: ../../howto/sorting.rst:67
msgid ""
"A common pattern is to sort complex objects using some of the object's "
"indices as keys. For example:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../howto/sorting.rst:80
msgid ""
"The same technique works for objects with named attributes. For example:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../howto/sorting.rst:101
msgid "Operator Module Functions"
msgstr ""

#: ../../howto/sorting.rst:103
msgid ""
"The key-function patterns shown above are very common, so Python provides "
"convenience functions to make accessor functions easier and faster. The "
":mod:`operator` module has :func:`~operator.itemgetter`, "
":func:`~operator.attrgetter`, and a :func:`~operator.methodcaller` function."
msgstr ""

#: ../../howto/sorting.rst:108
msgid "Using those functions, the above examples become simpler and faster:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../howto/sorting.rst:120
msgid ""
"The operator module functions allow multiple levels of sorting. For example,"
" to sort by *grade* then by *age*:"

msgid "Ascending and Descending"

#: ../../howto/sorting.rst:134
msgid ""
"Both :meth:`list.sort` and :func:`sorted` accept a *reverse* parameter with "
"a boolean value. This is used to flag descending sorts. For example, to get "
"the student data in reverse *age* order:"

msgid "Sort Stability and Complex Sorts"
msgstr ""

#: ../../howto/sorting.rst:149
msgid ""
"Sorts are guaranteed to be `stable "
"<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm#Stability>`_\\. That means "
"that when multiple records have the same key, their original order is "
"preserved."
msgstr ""

#: ../../howto/sorting.rst:159
msgid ""
"Notice how the two records for *blue* retain their original order so that "
"``('blue', 1)`` is guaranteed to precede ``('blue', 2)``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../howto/sorting.rst:162
msgid ""
"This wonderful property lets you build complex sorts in a series of sorting "
"steps. For example, to sort the student data by descending *grade* and then "
"ascending *age*, do the *age* sort first and then sort again using *grade*:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../howto/sorting.rst:172
msgid ""
"This can be abstracted out into a wrapper function that can take a list and "
"tuples of field and order to sort them on multiple passes."
msgstr ""

#: ../../howto/sorting.rst:185
msgid ""
"The `Timsort <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timsort>`_ algorithm used in "
"Python does multiple sorts efficiently because it can take advantage of any "
"ordering already present in a dataset."

msgid "Decorate-Sort-Undecorate"
msgstr ""

#: ../../howto/sorting.rst:192
msgid "This idiom is called Decorate-Sort-Undecorate after its three steps:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../howto/sorting.rst:194
msgid ""
"First, the initial list is decorated with new values that control the sort "
"order."
msgstr ""

#: ../../howto/sorting.rst:196
msgid "Second, the decorated list is sorted."
msgstr ""

#: ../../howto/sorting.rst:198
msgid ""
"Finally, the decorations are removed, creating a list that contains only the"
" initial values in the new order."
msgstr ""

#: ../../howto/sorting.rst:201
msgid ""
"For example, to sort the student data by *grade* using the DSU approach:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../howto/sorting.rst:208
msgid ""
"This idiom works because tuples are compared lexicographically; the first "
"items are compared; if they are the same then the second items are compared,"
" and so on."
msgstr ""

#: ../../howto/sorting.rst:212
msgid ""
"It is not strictly necessary in all cases to include the index *i* in the "
"decorated list, but including it gives two benefits:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../howto/sorting.rst:215
msgid ""
"The sort is stable -- if two items have the same key, their order will be "
"preserved in the sorted list."
msgstr ""

#: ../../howto/sorting.rst:218
msgid ""
"The original items do not have to be comparable because the ordering of the "
"decorated tuples will be determined by at most the first two items. So for "
"example the original list could contain complex numbers which cannot be "
"sorted directly."
msgstr ""

#: ../../howto/sorting.rst:223
msgid ""
"Another name for this idiom is `Schwartzian transform "
"<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwartzian_transform>`_\\, after Randal L. "
"Schwartz, who popularized it among Perl programmers."
msgstr ""

#: ../../howto/sorting.rst:227

"Now that Python sorting provides key-functions, this technique is not often "
"needed."

#: ../../howto/sorting.rst:230
msgid "Comparison Functions"
msgstr ""

#: ../../howto/sorting.rst:232
msgid ""
"Unlike key functions that return an absolute value for sorting, a comparison"
" function computes the relative ordering for two inputs."
msgstr ""

#: ../../howto/sorting.rst:235
msgid ""
"For example, a `balance scale "
"<https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/17/Balance_Ã _tabac_1850.JPG>`_"
" compares two samples giving a relative ordering: lighter, equal, or "
"heavier. Likewise, a comparison function such as ``cmp(a, b)`` will return a"
" negative value for less-than, zero if the inputs are equal, or a positive "
"value for greater-than."
msgstr ""

#: ../../howto/sorting.rst:242
msgid ""
"It is common to encounter comparison functions when translating algorithms "
"from other languages.  Also, some libraries provide comparison functions as "
"part of their API.  For example, :func:`locale.strcoll` is a comparison "
"function."
msgstr ""

#: ../../howto/sorting.rst:246
msgid ""
"To accommodate those situations, Python provides "
":class:`functools.cmp_to_key` to wrap the comparison function to make it "
"usable as a key function::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../howto/sorting.rst:253
msgid "Odds and Ends"
msgstr ""

#: ../../howto/sorting.rst:255
msgid ""
"For locale aware sorting, use :func:`locale.strxfrm` for a key function or "
":func:`locale.strcoll` for a comparison function.  This is necessary because"
" \"alphabetical\" sort orderings can vary across cultures even if the "
"underlying alphabet is the same."
msgstr ""

#: ../../howto/sorting.rst:260
msgid ""
"The *reverse* parameter still maintains sort stability (so that records with"
" equal keys retain the original order). Interestingly, that effect can be "
"simulated without the parameter by using the builtin :func:`reversed` "
"function twice:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../howto/sorting.rst:274
msgid ""
"The sort routines use ``<`` when making comparisons between two objects. So,"
" it is easy to add a standard sort order to a class by defining an "
":meth:`~object.__lt__` method:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../howto/sorting.rst:284
msgid ""
"However, note that ``<`` can fall back to using :meth:`~object.__gt__` if "
":meth:`~object.__lt__` is not implemented (see :func:`object.__lt__`)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../howto/sorting.rst:287
msgid ""
"Key functions need not depend directly on the objects being sorted. A key "
"function can also access external resources. For instance, if the student "
"grades are stored in a dictionary, they can be used to sort a separate list "
"of student names:"
msgstr ""
