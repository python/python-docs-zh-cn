"First, it's more obvious that you are using a method or instance attribute "
"instead of a local variable.  Reading ``self.x`` or ``self.meth()`` makes it"
" absolutely clear that an instance variable or method is used even if you "
"don't know the class definition by heart.  In C++, you can sort of tell by "
"the lack of a local variable declaration (assuming globals are rare or "
"easily recognizable) -- but in Python, there are no local variable "
"declarations, so you'd have to look up the class definition to be sure.  "
"Some C++ and Java coding standards call for instance attributes to have an "
"``m_`` prefix, so this explicitness is still useful in those languages, too."
msgstr ""
"首先，更明显的显示出，使用的是方法或实例属性而不是局部变量。 阅读 ``self.x`` 或 ``self.meth()`` "
"可以清楚地表明，即使您不知道类的定义，也会使用实例变量或方法。在 C++ 中，可以通过缺少局部变量声明来判断（假设全局变量很少见或容易识别） —— "
"但是在 Python 中没有局部变量声明，所以必须查找类定义才能确定。 一些 C++ 和 Java 编码标准要求实例属性具有 ``m_`` "
"前缀，因此这种显式性在这些语言中仍然有用。"

"Second, it means that no special syntax is necessary if you want to "
"explicitly reference or call the method from a particular class.  In C++, if"
" you want to use a method from a base class which is overridden in a derived"
" class, you have to use the ``::`` operator -- in Python you can write "
"``baseclass.methodname(self, <argument list>)``.  This is particularly "
"useful for :meth:`__init__` methods, and in general in cases where a derived"
" class method wants to extend the base class method of the same name and "

"其次，这意味着如果要显式引用或从特定类调用该方法，不需要特殊语法。 在 C++ 中，如果你想使用在派生类中重写基类中的方法，你必须使用 ``::`` "

msgid ""
"Finally, for instance variables it solves a syntactic problem with "
"assignment: since local variables in Python are (by definition!) those "
"variables to which a value is assigned in a function body (and that aren't "
"explicitly declared global), there has to be some way to tell the "
"interpreter that an assignment was meant to assign to an instance variable "
"instead of to a local variable, and it should preferably be syntactic (for "
"efficiency reasons).  C++ does this through declarations, but Python doesn't"
" have declarations and it would be a pity having to introduce them just for "
"this purpose.  Using the explicit ``self.var`` solves this nicely.  "
"Similarly, for using instance variables, having to write ``self.var`` means "
"that references to unqualified names inside a method don't have to search "
"the instance's directories.  To put it another way, local variables and "
"instance variables live in two different namespaces, and you need to tell "
"Python which namespace to use."
msgstr ""
"最后，它解决了变量赋值的语法问题：为了 Python "
"中的局部变量（根据定义！）在函数体中赋值的那些变量（并且没有明确声明为全局）赋值，就必须以某种方式告诉解释器一个赋值是为了分配一个实例变量而不是一个局部变量，它最好是通过语法实现的（出于效率原因）。"
" C++ 通过声明来做到这一点，但是 Python 没有声明，仅仅为了这个目的而引入它们会很可惜。 使用显式的 ``self.var`` "
"很好地解决了这个问题。 类似地，对于使用实例变量，必须编写 ``self.var`` 意味着对方法内部的非限定名称的引用不必搜索实例的目录。 "
"换句话说，局部变量和实例变量存在于两个不同的命名空间中，您需要告诉 Python 使用哪个命名空间。"
