"You need to realize that your Python scripts have to be processed by another"

"First, you need to make sure that your command window recognises the word "

"You may also find that you have a Start-menu entry such as "
":menuselection:`Start --> Programs --> Python 3.x --> Python (command line)`"

msgid ""
"Usually Python starts very quickly on Windows, but occasionally there are "
"bug reports that Python suddenly begins to take a long time to start up.  "

"The problem may be caused by a misconfiguration of virus checking software "

" virus scanning software on your systems to ensure that they are indeed "

msgid ""
"Yes, .pyd files are dll's, but there are a few differences.  If you have a "
"DLL named ``foo.pyd``, then it must have a function ``PyInit_foo()``.  You "
"can then write Python \"import foo\", and Python will search for foo.pyd (as"
" well as foo.py, foo.pyc) and if it finds it, will attempt to call "

"Note that the search path for foo.pyd is PYTHONPATH, not the same as the "
"path that Windows uses to search for foo.dll.  Also, foo.pyd need not be "
"present to run your program, whereas if you linked your program with a dll, "
"the dll is required.  Of course, foo.pyd is required if you want to say "
"``import foo``.  In a DLL, linkage is declared in the source code with "
"``__declspec(dllexport)``. In a .pyd, linkage is defined in a list of "

"Do _not_ build Python into your .exe file directly.  On Windows, Python must"
" be a DLL to handle importing modules that are themselves DLL's.  (This is "
"the first key undocumented fact.)  Instead, link to :file:`python{NN}.dll`; "
"it is typically installed in ``C:\\Windows\\System``.  *NN* is the Python "
"version, a number such as \"33\" for Python 3.3."
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq/windows.rst:177
msgid ""
"You can link to Python in two different ways.  Load-time linking means "
"linking against :file:`python{NN}.lib`, while run-time linking means linking"
" against :file:`python{NN}.dll`.  (General note: :file:`python{NN}.lib` is "
"the so-called \"import lib\" corresponding to :file:`python{NN}.dll`.  It "
"merely defines symbols for the linker.)"
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq/windows.rst:183
msgid ""
"Run-time linking greatly simplifies link options; everything happens at run "
"time.  Your code must load :file:`python{NN}.dll` using the Windows "
"``LoadLibraryEx()`` routine.  The code must also use access routines and "
"data in :file:`python{NN}.dll` (that is, Python's C API's) using pointers "
"obtained by the Windows ``GetProcAddress()`` routine.  Macros can make using"
" these pointers transparent to any C code that calls routines in Python's C "

"If you use SWIG, it is easy to create a Python \"extension module\" that "
"will make the app's data and methods available to Python.  SWIG will handle "
"just about all the grungy details for you.  The result is C code that you "
"link *into* your .exe file (!)  You do _not_ have to create a DLL file, and "
"this also simplifies linking."
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq/windows.rst:201
msgid ""
"SWIG will create an init function (a C function) whose name depends on the "
"name of the extension module.  For example, if the name of the module is "
"leo, the init function will be called initleo().  If you use SWIG shadow "
"classes, as you should, the init function will be called initleoc().  This "
"initializes a mostly hidden helper class used by the shadow class."
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq/windows.rst:207
msgid ""
"The reason you can link the C code in step 2 into your .exe file is that "
"calling the initialization function is equivalent to importing the module "

"Problem 1: The so-called \"Very High Level\" functions that take FILE * "
"arguments will not work in a multi-compiler environment because each "

"Using a Python shell script to put up a Python interpreter window from "
"inside your Windows app is not a good idea; the resulting window will be "
"independent of your app's windowing system.  Rather, you (or the "
"wxPythonWindow class) should create a \"native\" interpreter window.  It is "
"easy to connect that window to the Python interpreter.  You can redirect "
"Python's i/o to _any_ object that supports read and write, so all you need "
