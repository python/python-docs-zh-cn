":mod:`distutils` is the original build and distribution system first added "
"to the Python standard library in 1998. While direct use of :mod:`distutils`"
" is being phased out, it still laid the foundation for the current packaging"
" and distribution infrastructure, and it not only remains part of the "
"standard library, but its name lives on in other ways (such as the name of "
"the mailing list used to coordinate Python packaging standards development)."

"`setuptools`_ is a (largely) drop-in replacement for :mod:`distutils` first "
"published in 2004. Its most notable addition over the unmodified "
":mod:`distutils` tools was the ability to declare dependencies on other "
"packages. It is currently recommended as a more regularly updated "
"alternative to :mod:`distutils` that offers consistent support for more "
"recent packaging standards across a wide range of Python versions."

"binary packaging format (called \"wheels\" or \"wheel files\" and defined in"
" :pep:`427`) that allows Python libraries, even those including binary "
"extensions, to be installed on a system without needing to be built locally."
