"Bill Janssen made extensive improvements to Python 2.6's support for the "
"Secure Sockets Layer by adding a new module, :mod:`ssl`, that's built atop "
"the `OpenSSL <https://www.openssl.org/>`__ library. This new module provides"
" more control over the protocol negotiated, the X.509 certificates used, and"
" has better support for writing SSL servers (as opposed to clients) in "
