":pep:`488` does away with the concept of ``.pyo`` files. This means that "
"``.pyc`` files represent both unoptimized and optimized bytecode. To prevent"
" the need to constantly regenerate bytecode files, ``.pyc`` files now have "
"an optional ``opt-`` tag in their name when the bytecode is optimized. This "

"generated from :option:`-O`, and :option:`-OO` may now exist simultaneously."
