"Regular Python dictionaries iterate over key/value pairs in arbitrary order."

"The OrderedDict API is substantially the same as regular dictionaries but "
"will iterate over keys and values in a guaranteed order depending on when a "
"key was first inserted.  If a new entry overwrites an existing entry, the "
"original insertion position is left unchanged.  Deleting an entry and "

"The standard library now supports use of ordered dictionaries in several "

"now returns an ordered dictionary with the values appearing in the same "
"order as the underlying tuple indices.  The :mod:`json` module is being "

msgstr ""

#: ../../whatsnew/3.1.rst:213
msgid ""
"The significance is easily seen with a number like ``1.1`` which does not "
"have an exact equivalent in binary floating point.  Since there is no exact "

"representable value which is ``0x1.199999999999ap+0`` in hex or "

#: ../../whatsnew/3.1.rst:221
msgid ""
"What is new is how the number gets displayed.  Formerly, Python used a "
"simple approach.  The value of ``repr(1.1)`` was computed as ``format(1.1, "
"'.17g')`` which evaluated to ``'1.1000000000000001'``. The advantage of "
"using 17 digits was that it relied on IEEE-754 guarantees to assure that "
"``eval(repr(1.1))`` would round-trip exactly to its original value.  The "
"disadvantage is that many people found the output to be confusing (mistaking"
" intrinsic limitations of binary floating point representation as being a "
"problem with Python itself)."

"The new algorithm for ``repr(1.1)`` is smarter and returns ``'1.1'``. "

"The new algorithm tends to emit cleaner representations when possible, but "

"The new algorithm depends on certain features in the underlying floating "
