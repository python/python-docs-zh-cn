"Python 3.0 uses the concepts of *text* and (binary) *data* instead of "

":class:`str`, the type used to hold data is :class:`bytes`.  The biggest "

"and 8-bit strings in Python 2.x, it would work if the 8-bit string happened "
"to contain only 7-bit (ASCII) bytes, but you would get "
":exc:`UnicodeDecodeError` if it contained non-ASCII values.  This value-"

"having to do with mixing encoded and unencoded text.  To be prepared in "
"Python 2.x, start using :class:`unicode` for all unencoded text, and "

"Python 3.0, whereas in 2.6, ``ur'\\u20ac'`` was the single \"euro\" "

"Files opened as text files (still the default mode for :func:`open`) always "

"Binary files (opened with a ``b`` in the mode argument) always use bytes in "
"memory.  This means that if a file is opened using an incorrect mode or "
"encoding, I/O will likely fail loudly, instead of silently producing "
"incorrect data.  It also means that even Unix users will have to specify the"
" correct mode (text or binary) when opening a file.  There is a platform-"
"dependent default encoding, which on Unixy platforms can be set with the "
"``LANG`` environment variable (and sometimes also with some other platform-"
"specific locale-related environment variables).  In many cases, but not all,"
" the system default is UTF-8; you should never count on this default.  Any "

"Filenames are passed to and returned from APIs as (Unicode) strings. This "

"natively stored as Unicode.)  As a work-around, most APIs (e.g. :func:`open`"
" and many functions in the :mod:`os` module) that take filenames accept "
":class:`bytes` objects as well as strings, and a few APIs have a way to ask "
"for a :class:`bytes` return value.  Thus, :func:`os.listdir` returns a list "
"of :class:`bytes` instances if the argument is a :class:`bytes` instance, "
"and :func:`os.getcwdb` returns the current working directory as a "

"It is not recommended to try to write source code that runs unchanged under "
"both Python 2.6 and 3.0; you'd have to use a very contorted coding style, "
"e.g. avoiding ``print`` statements, metaclasses, and much more.  If you are "
"maintaining a library that needs to support both Python 2.6 and Python 3.0, "
"the best approach is to modify step 3 above by editing the 2.6 version of "
"the source code and running the ``2to3`` translator again, rather than "
"editing the 3.0 version of the source code."
