"A long time ago I wrote a Web page listing flaws in Python's design.  One of"
" the most significant flaws was that it's impossible to subclass Python "
"types implemented in C.  In particular, it's not possible to subclass built-"
"in types, so you can't just subclass, say, lists in order to add a single "
"useful method to them. The :mod:`UserList` module provides a class that "

"In previous versions of Python, there was no consistent way to discover what"

"informal conventions, such as defining :attr:`__members__` and "
":attr:`__methods__` attributes that were lists of names, but often the "
"author of an extension type or a class wouldn't bother to define them.  You "
"could fall back on inspecting the :attr:`~object.__dict__` of an object, but"

"The one big idea underlying the new class model is that an API for "

"For methods, :meth:`descriptor.__get__` returns a temporary object that's "

"descriptors that wrap up just the method, or the method and the class.  As a"
" brief explanation of these new kinds of methods, static methods aren't "

"More new features, such as slots and properties, are also implemented as new"

":class:`A`, where :meth:`save` would be found and returned.  :meth:`C.save` "

"``super(class, obj)``, which returns  a bound superclass object (not the "

":func:`super` can also return unbound superclass objects when called as "

msgid "Attribute Access"

#: ../../whatsnew/2.2.rst:311
msgid ""
"A fair number of sophisticated Python classes define hooks for attribute "
"access using :meth:`__getattr__`; most commonly this is done for "
"convenience, to make code more readable by automatically mapping an "
"attribute access such as ``obj.parent`` into a method call such as "
"``obj.get_parent``.  Python 2.2 adds some new ways of controlling attribute "
"access."
msgstr ""

#: ../../whatsnew/2.2.rst:317
msgid ""
"First, ``__getattr__(attr_name)`` is still supported by new-style classes, "
"and nothing about it has changed.  As before, it will be called when an "
"attempt is made to access ``obj.foo`` and no attribute named ``foo`` is "
"found in the instance's dictionary."
msgstr ""

#: ../../whatsnew/2.2.rst:322
msgid ""
"New-style classes also support a new method, "
"``__getattribute__(attr_name)``.  The difference between the two methods is "
"that :meth:`__getattribute__` is *always* called whenever any attribute is "
"accessed, while the old :meth:`__getattr__` is only called if ``foo`` isn't "
"found in the instance's dictionary."
msgstr ""

#: ../../whatsnew/2.2.rst:328
msgid ""
"However, Python 2.2's support for :dfn:`properties` will often be a simpler "
"way to trap attribute references.  Writing a :meth:`__getattr__` method is "
"complicated because to avoid recursion you can't use regular attribute "
"accesses inside them, and instead have to mess around with the contents of "
":attr:`~object.__dict__`. :meth:`__getattr__` methods also end up being "
"called by Python when it checks for other methods such as :meth:`__repr__` "
"or :meth:`__coerce__`, and so have to be written with this in mind. Finally,"
" calling a function on every attribute access results in a sizable "
"performance loss."
msgstr ""

#: ../../whatsnew/2.2.rst:337
msgid ""
":class:`property` is a new built-in type that packages up three functions "
"that get, set, or delete an attribute, and a docstring.  For example, if you"
" want to define a :attr:`size` attribute that's computed, but also settable,"
" you could write::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../whatsnew/2.2.rst:357
msgid ""
"That is certainly clearer and easier to write than a pair of "
":meth:`__getattr__`/:meth:`__setattr__` methods that check for the "
":attr:`size` attribute and handle it specially while retrieving all other "
"attributes from the instance's :attr:`~object.__dict__`.  Accesses to "
":attr:`size` are also the only ones which have to perform the work of "
"calling a function, so references to other attributes run at their usual "
"speed."

"Finally, it's possible to constrain the list of attributes that can be "
"referenced on an object using the new :attr:`~object.__slots__` class "
"attribute. Python objects are usually very dynamic; at any time it's "
"possible to define a new attribute on an instance by just doing "
"``obj.new_attr=1``.   A new-style class can define a class attribute named "
":attr:`~object.__slots__` to limit the legal attributes  to a particular set"
