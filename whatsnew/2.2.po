"The most significant change is the ability to build Python as a framework, "
"enabled by supplying the :option:`!--enable-framework` option to the "
"configure script when compiling Python.  According to Jack Jansen, \"This "
"installs a self-contained Python installation plus the OS X framework "
"\"glue\" into :file:`/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework` (or another "
"location of choice). For now there is little immediate added benefit to this"
" (actually, there is the disadvantage that you have to change your PATH to "
"be able to find Python), but it is the basis for creating a full-blown "
"Python application, porting the MacPython IDE, possibly using Python as a "
"standard OSA scripting language and much more.\""
