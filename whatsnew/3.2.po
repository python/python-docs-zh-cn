"In the past, extension modules built for one Python version were often not "

"过去，为一个 Python 版本所构建的扩展模块通常无法用于其他 Python 版本。 特别是在 Windows 上，每一个 Python "

" a consequence, extension modules built for 3.2 in that mode will also work "

"memory structures can still be built, but will need to be recompiled for "

"构建的扩展模块也将能在 3.3、3.4 等版本中运行。 使用了内存结构体细节数据的扩展模块仍然可以被构建，但将需要为每个新特性发布版重新编译。"
