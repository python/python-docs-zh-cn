"About 10 IDLE features were implemented as supposedly optional extensions. "
"Their different behavior could be confusing or worse for users and not good "

" user configurable key bindings for builtin features are now handled "
"uniformly. Now, editing a binding in a keyset only affects its value in the "
"keyset. All bindings are defined together in the system-specific default "
"keysets in config-extensions.def. All custom keysets are saved as a whole in"
" config-extension.cfg.  All take effect as soon as one clicks Apply or Ok. "
"The affected events are '<<force-open-completions>>', '<<expand-word>>', "
"'<<force-open-calltip>>', '<<flash-paren>>', '<<format-paragraph>>', '<<run-"
"module>>', '<<check-module>>', and '<<zoom-height>>'.  Any (global) "
