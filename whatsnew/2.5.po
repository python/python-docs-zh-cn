"The changes in Python 2.5 are an interesting mix of language and library "
"improvements. The library enhancements will be more important to Python's "
"user community, I think, because several widely useful packages were added."

" SQLite database module (:mod:`sqlite`), and the :mod:`ctypes` module for "
"calling C functions."

"The language changes are of middling significance.  Some pleasant new "
"features were added, but most of them aren't features that you'll use every "
"day. Conditional expressions were finally added to the language using a "
"novel syntax; see section :ref:`pep-308`.  The new ':keyword:`with`' "
"statement will make writing cleanup code easier (section :ref:`pep-343`).  "
"Values can now be passed into generators (section :ref:`pep-342`).  Imports "
"are now visible as either absolute or relative (section :ref:`pep-328`).  "
"Some corner cases of exception handling are handled better (section "
":ref:`pep-341`).  All these improvements are worthwhile, but they're "
"improvements to one specific language feature or another; none of them are "
"broad modifications to Python's semantics."

"There have been endless tedious discussions of syntax on both python-dev and"
" comp.lang.python.  A vote was even held that found the majority of voters "
"wanted conditional expressions in some form, but there was no syntax that "

"Evaluation is still lazy as in existing Boolean expressions, so the order of"
" evaluation jumps around a bit.  The *condition* expression in the middle is"
" evaluated first, and the *true_value* expression is evaluated only if the "
"condition was true.  Similarly, the *false_value* expression is only "
"evaluated when the condition is false."

msgid ""
"This syntax may seem strange and backwards; why does the condition go in the"
" *middle* of the expression, and not in the front as in C's ``c ? x : y``?  "
"The decision was checked by applying the new syntax to the modules in the "
"standard library and seeing how the resulting code read.  In many cases "
"where a conditional expression is used, one value seems to be the 'common "
"case' and one value is an 'exceptional case', used only on rarer occasions "
"when the condition isn't met.  The conditional syntax makes this pattern a "
"bit more obvious::"

"I read the above statement as meaning \"here *contents* is  usually assigned"

"very often where there  isn't a clear common and uncommon case."

"There was some discussion of whether the language should require surrounding"

"In the first version, I think a reader's eye might group the statement into "

"better, in my opinion, because it makes it clear that the assignment is "
"always performed and the choice is being made between two values."
