"The largest change in Python 2.1 is to Python's scoping rules.  In Python "
"2.0, at any given time there are at most three namespaces used to look up "
"variable names: local, module-level, and the built-in namespace.  This often"

"(how often do you recursively define interior functions like this?), but "
"this also made using the :keyword:`lambda` expression clumsier, and this was"

"find local variables being copied by passing them as the default values of "
"arguments. ::"

"The most significant change to Python 2.1 is that static scoping has been "
"added to the language to fix this problem.  As a first effect, the "
"``name=name`` default argument is now unnecessary in the above example.  Put"
" simply, when a given variable name is not assigned a value within a "
"function (by an assignment, or the :keyword:`def`, :keyword:`class`, or "
":keyword:`import` statements), references to the variable will be looked up "
"in the local namespace of the enclosing scope.  A more detailed explanation "

"This change may cause some compatibility problems for code where the same "

"read in the first place."

msgid ""
"One side effect of the change is that the ``from module import *`` and "
"``exec`` statements have been made illegal inside a function scope under "
"certain conditions.  The Python reference manual has said all along that "
"``from module import *`` is only legal at the top level of a module, but the"
" CPython interpreter has never enforced this before.  As part of the "
"implementation of nested scopes, the compiler which turns Python source into"
" bytecodes has to generate different code to access variables in a "
"containing scope.  ``from module import *`` and ``exec`` make it impossible "
"for the compiler to figure this out, because they add names to the local "
"namespace that are unknowable at compile time. Therefore, if a function "
"contains function definitions or :keyword:`lambda` expressions with free "
"variables, the compiler will flag this by raising a :exc:`SyntaxError` "

":func:`PyMem_New`, it has to be freed using :func:`PyMem_Del`, not "
