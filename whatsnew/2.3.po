"Pymalloc, a specialized object allocator written by Vladimir Marangozov, was"
" a feature added to Python 2.1.  Pymalloc is intended to be faster than the "
"system :c:func:`malloc` and to have less memory overhead for allocation "
"patterns typical of Python programs. The allocator uses C's :c:func:`malloc`"
" function to get large pools of memory and then fulfills smaller memory "
"requests from these pools."

"In 2.1 and 2.2, pymalloc was an experimental feature and wasn't enabled by "

"the :option:`!--with-pymalloc` option to the :program:`configure` script.  "

"There's one particularly common error that causes problems.  There are a "
"number of memory allocation functions in Python's C API that have previously"
" just been aliases for the C library's :c:func:`malloc` and :c:func:`free`, "
"meaning that if you accidentally called mismatched functions the error "
"wouldn't be noticeable. When the object allocator is enabled, these "
"functions aren't aliases of :c:func:`malloc` and :c:func:`free` any more, "
"and calling the wrong function to free memory may get you a core dump.  For "
"example, if memory was allocated using :c:func:`PyObject_Malloc`, it has to "
"be freed using :c:func:`PyObject_Free`, not :c:func:`free`.  A few modules "
