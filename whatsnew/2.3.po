"The main themes for Python 2.3 are polishing some of the features added in "
"2.2, adding various small but useful enhancements to the core language, and "
"expanding the standard library.  The new object model introduced in the "
"previous version has benefited from 18 months of bugfixes and from "
"optimization efforts that have improved the performance of new-style "
"classes.  A few new built-in functions have been added such as :func:`sum` "
"and :func:`enumerate`.  The :keyword:`in` operator can now be used for "
"substring searches (e.g. ``\"ab\" in \"abc\"`` returns :const:`True`)."

"You're doubtless familiar with how function calls work in Python or C. When "
"you call a function, it gets a private namespace where its local variables "
"are created.  When the function reaches a :keyword:`return` statement, the "
"local variables are destroyed and the resulting value is returned to the "
"caller.  A later call to the same function will get a fresh new set of local"
" variables. But, what if the local variables weren't thrown away on exiting "
"a function? What if you could later resume the function where it left off?  "

msgid ""
"A new keyword, :keyword:`yield`, was introduced for generators.  Any "

"When you call a generator function, it doesn't return a single value; "
"instead it returns a generator object that supports the iterator protocol.  "
"On executing the :keyword:`yield` statement, the generator outputs the value"
" of ``i``, similar to a :keyword:`return` statement.  The big difference "
"between :keyword:`!yield` and a :keyword:`!return` statement is that on "
"reaching a :keyword:`!yield` the generator's state of execution is suspended"
" and local variables are preserved.  On the next call to the generator's "
"``.next()`` method, the function will resume executing immediately after the"
" :keyword:`!yield` statement.  (For complicated reasons, the "
":keyword:`!yield` statement isn't allowed inside the :keyword:`try` block of"
" a :keyword:`!try`...\\ :keyword:`!finally` statement; read :pep:`255` for a"

"Inside a generator function, the :keyword:`return` statement can only be "
"used without a value, and signals the end of the procession of values; "
"afterwards the generator cannot return any further values. "
":keyword:`!return` with a value, such as ``return 5``, is a syntax error "
"inside a generator function.  The end of the generator's results can also be"
" indicated by raising :exc:`StopIteration` manually, or by just letting the "
"flow of execution fall off the bottom of the function."
msgstr ""

#: ../../whatsnew/2.3.rst:197
msgid ""
"You could achieve the effect of generators manually by writing your own "
"class and storing all the local variables of the generator as instance "
"variables.  For example, returning a list of integers could be done by "
"setting ``self.count`` to 0, and having the :meth:`next` method increment "
"``self.count`` and return it. However, for a moderately complicated "
"generator, writing a corresponding class would be much messier. "
":file:`Lib/test/test_generators.py` contains a number of more interesting "

"The idea of generators comes from other programming languages, especially "

"In Icon the :func:`find` function returns the indexes at which the substring"
" \"or\" is found: 3, 23, 33.  In the :keyword:`if` statement, ``i`` is first"
" assigned a value of 3, but 3 is less than 5, so the comparison fails, and "
"Icon retries it with the second value of 23.  23 is greater than 5, so the "
"comparison now succeeds, and the code prints the value 23 to the screen."

"Python doesn't go nearly as far as Icon in adopting generators as a central "
"concept.  Generators are considered part of the core Python language, but "
"learning or using them isn't compulsory; if they don't solve any problems "
"that you have, feel free to ignore them. One novel feature of Python's "
"interface as compared to Icon's is that a generator's state is represented "

"Pymalloc, a specialized object allocator written by Vladimir Marangozov, was"
" a feature added to Python 2.1.  Pymalloc is intended to be faster than the "
"system :c:func:`malloc` and to have less memory overhead for allocation "
"patterns typical of Python programs. The allocator uses C's :c:func:`malloc`"
" function to get large pools of memory and then fulfills smaller memory "
"requests from these pools."
msgstr ""

#: ../../whatsnew/2.3.rst:1813

"In 2.1 and 2.2, pymalloc was an experimental feature and wasn't enabled by "

"the :option:`!--with-pymalloc` option to the :program:`configure` script.  "
"In 2.3, pymalloc has had further enhancements and is now enabled by default;"

"There's one particularly common error that causes problems.  There are a "
"number of memory allocation functions in Python's C API that have previously"
" just been aliases for the C library's :c:func:`malloc` and :c:func:`free`, "
"meaning that if you accidentally called mismatched functions the error "
"wouldn't be noticeable. When the object allocator is enabled, these "
"functions aren't aliases of :c:func:`malloc` and :c:func:`free` any more, "
"and calling the wrong function to free memory may get you a core dump.  For "
"example, if memory was allocated using :c:func:`PyObject_Malloc`, it has to "
