"Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting "
"Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see https://www.cwi.nl/) in the Netherlands as a "
"successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's principal "
"author, although it includes many contributions from others."

"Python 由荷兰数学和计算机科学研究学会（CWI，见 https://www.cwi.nl/ ）的 Guido van Rossum 于 1990 "
"年代初设计，作为一门叫做 ABC 的语言的替代品。尽管 Python 包含了许多来自其他人的贡献，Guido 仍是其主要作者。"

"In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for National "

"In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to BeOpen.com "
"to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same year, the "
"PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations (now Zope Corporation; see "
"https://www.zope.org/).  In 2001, the Python Software Foundation (PSF, see "
"https://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a non-profit organization created "
"specifically to own Python-related Intellectual Property.  Zope Corporation "
"is a sponsoring member of the PSF."
